Instructions for compiling on MacOSX
------------------------------------

The recent version of Apple's C compiler, installed using the command line utilities, no longer
compile Xgremlin correctly. The solution is to use gcc - the same compiler as used on Ubuntu
and Windows/WSL. This can be installed using Homebrew using
'brew install gcc'.
The compiler is installed in /usr/local/bin and you should look at the version installed
and modify the file 'macosx' in the configurations directory if necessary.

On Ventura (13.6.3), the X11 libraries are in /usr/X11R6/lib and the include files are in
/usr/X11R6/include. The app-defaults file is in
/opt/X11/share/X11/app-defaults/
and the Makefile should be modified as follows:
APPDEF = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults
before running 'make install' to ensure that the 'Xgremlin' file is copied to the right place.
If you run Xgremlin and get a window with lots of lines, no labeled menus, and no colors,
you should copy the file 'Xgremlin' to the correct place.
