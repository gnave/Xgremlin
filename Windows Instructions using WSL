Instructions for compiling and installing Xgremlin on Windows 10 or 11 using WSL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Install and update the wsl system. Details can be found at:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps.
 -- Go to the Power Shell:
    wsl --install       if you have not previously installed wsl or
    wsl --update        if you have
    wsl --shutdown      to restart wsl and implement the changes
    wsl                 to start it up again.

2) Find and install an X server to use with the program. I had good luck with MovaXterm, at
https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net

3) Install the libraries and programs needed to compile and run Xgremlin, while in wsl:
   sudo apt install gfortran
   sudo apt install make
   sudo apt install unzip
   sudo apt install libx11-dev
   sudo apt install libxt-dev
   sudo apt install libxaw7-dev

You may also need to find the find StringDefs.h and copy it to the X11 include file directory
at /usr/include/X11. I found the file at:
code.woboq.org/kde/include/X11/StringDefs.h.html

4) You should now be able to configure and make Xgremlin using the instructions in the README:
./Configure
make linux-i386
make install
make install-doc

I have modified the configuration and makefiles to make the default libraries and include
files work with Ubuntu and Windows WSL, so you shouldn't need to change anything. The Makefile
also now makes the directories in /usr/local/xgremlin if they are not there, so the documentation
should install correctly as well.

5) If you want to use your default Windows browser, set the browser in the xgremlin.conf
file to wslview before typing install-doc. The one installed on the system may not work, and if
this is the case, try updating it from the wsl utilities repository:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wslutilities/wslu
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade.

Let me know how you get on and if you encounter any problems
