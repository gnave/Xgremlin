<h2>A list of things that are still left to do (as of version 2.48)</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<ul>
<li>base the line fitting package on MINPACK because the current line fitting
  suffers from 'simplex disease'.<p>

<li>Develop a way to analyse complex spectra (with e.g. hyperfine structure )
  efficiently maybe by using a neural network simulator for line finding.<p>

<li>Phase correction needs cleaning up.<p>

<li>change over to Hui et al. 's method of calculation fo the Voigt function
  because it has higher accuracy (at some performance penalty). Since it is
  in many cases sufficient to fit Gauss profiles allow to explicitely fit
  Gauss profiles. This is again more accurate and also faster than 
  evaluating the Voigt function. Another advantage is that with
  Hui's approximation one can make use of the analytic properties of the 
  Voigt function to speed up least squares fitting.<p>

<li>(Maybe) rewrite the command interpreter in Xgremlin in such a way that 
  it provides a minimal language with allows some form of flow control and
  a better way of defining new commmands.(Probably impossible)<p>

</ul>
<br>
<b>Things to be done some time:</b>

<ul>
<li>use GNU autoconf for configuration which should make installation a lot
  more flexible. This would resolve some of the nagging configuration
  problems under Unix.<p>

<li>write a program ('idlin') which allows to insert id strings from programs 
  such as 'strans' into line list databases.<p>

<li>rewrite 'gboss.f' so it becomes understandable and more flexible.
  (Make it possible to use aliases with parameter substitution which
   shouldn't be too difficult.)<p>

<li> Use Motif instead of the Athena widgets. This would be nice
but is a lot of work for not much more than good looks.<p>

</ul>
