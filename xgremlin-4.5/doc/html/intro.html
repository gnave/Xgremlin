<h1>A Short Introduction to Xgremlin</h1>
	
<h2>General</h2> 

Xgremlin is a hardware and operating system independent version of the
data analysis program <b>Gremlin</b> for Fourier transform spectrometry.
Xgremlin runs on PCs and workstations that use the <b>X11 window
system</b>.  In Xgremlin few things have changed from Gremlin and
someone familiar with Gremlin should immediately be able to work with
Xgremlin.<p>

Gremlin has two main input modes, an <b>edit mode</b> where commands
are entered at a command prompt and a graphical <b>plot mode</b> with
a different set of commands.  Xgremlin emulates these two input modes
by splitting the application main window into an upper pane which is
used for plotting and a lower pane used for command editing and
program output. Both windows remain visible all the time. After
startup Xgremlin is in edit mode and commands may be typed in at the
command prompt. To change over to plot mode either the button labeled
<b>Plotmode</b> or the <b>Tab</b> key must be pressed. Pressing either
of these again returns Xgremlin to 'edit' mode. The Xgremlin commands
in plot and edit mode are identical to those of Gremlin ( with a few
exceptions - the use of the Tab key being one of them ).<p>

<h2>Xgremlin startup</h2>
One area where Xgremlin differs from Gremlin significantly is
initialization.  When Xgremlin is started it first reads a system wide
initialization file <b>xgremlin.conf</b>. The system wide initialization
file is used to establish defaults that are applicable to any user on
a system such as the printer that is to be used for screen
dumps. Xgremlin then processes the personal initialization file
<b>.xgremlinrc</b> in the home directory.  The personal initialization file
can be used to taylor Xgremlin to the liking of each individual user
e.g. to associate certain commands with buttons or to modify the colors
used in the plotting window.<p>

<h2>GUI elements</h2> 
In Xgremlin, frequently used commands can be accessed conveniently
through simple mouse clicks on buttons. All important plot mode
commands for moving around in a plot are accessible through the row of
buttons on top of the plotting window. Whereas the functions of the
top row of buttons are fixed, Xgremlin has also a row of buttons
between the plot and the edit window which may be programmed by the
user with the <b>button</b> command. This provides a convenient
shortcut for frequently used plot or edit commands. A online help
system can be called up by selecting the menu entry <i>Help</i> in the
<i>Gremlins</i> menu. The menu entry <i>Phase/Tranform</i> pops up an
interface to phase correction and Fourier transforms. This is
explained in greater detail in the Xgremlin tutorial.
<p>

<h2>Command line editing</h2>
Xgremlin has a simple command line editor for the text window. 
The editor commands are reminiscent of those used in the much loved and
hated Unix editor Emacs:

<dl>
<dt> <b>Left arrow key</b>
<dd> Move cursor to the left
<dt> <b>Right arrow key</b>
<dd> Move cursor to the right
<dt> <b>Page Up key</b>
<dd> Scroll text in edit window back by one page
<dt> <b>Page down key</b>
<dd> Scroll text in edit window forward by one page
<dt> <b>Up arrow key</b>
<dd> Recall previous command or commands
<dt> <b>Conrol key + 'a' key</b>
<dd> Move cursor to beginning of the command line (Anfang)
<dt> <b>Control key + 'e' key</b>
<dd> Move cursor to end of the command line (Ende)
<dt> <b>Control key + 'k' key</b>
<dd> Delete everything from cursor position to end of line
<dt> <b>Backspace key</b>
<dd> Remove character to left of cursor
</dl>

<h2>Line lists</h2>
Binary line list (.lin) files are supported by Xgremlin independent of
the computer type Xgremlin is running on. A line list file written on
a PC with an Intel processor is readable on a Sun workstation and vice 
versa. In more technical terms: the byte order of data in .lin files
is always identical to the byte order of data in .lin files produced
by the original Gremlin program (i.e. <b>little endian</b> byte order).<p>

<h2>Gremlin commands not available in Xgremlin</h2>
A few commands that are found in Gremlin were eliminated in Xgremlin:

<dl>
<dt> <b>sys</b>
<dd> Creates a child process in Gremlin. This is obsolete in Xgremlin; if you 
     need a shell prompt just open another window.
<dt> <b>miniarc</b>
<dd> Superseded by the <a href="commands/response.html">response</a> command
<dt> <b>optronics</b>
<dd> Superseded by the <a href="commands/response.html">response</a> command
<dt> <b>greg</b>
<dd> Seems obsolete and no one knows what it was used for.
<dt> <b>headeredit</b>
<dd> Unclear how and what it was used for.
<dt> <b>print</b>
<dd> Mostly duplicated by <a href="commands/info.html">info</a>.
<dt> <b>extended</b>
<dd> Some but not all subfunctions of the <i>extended</i> command set were
     removed because they are obsolete. <i>extended worm</i> is gone too because
     is not documented and apparently must be rewritten anyway because it does
     not work.
