<h2>fits2nso - convert FTS data files from FITS format to NSO type 6 format</h2><p>

<b> Syntax:</b> <kbd>fits2nso [-f] [-h] [-r] &lt;input files&gt;</kbd><p>

The NIST UV-vis-IR Fourier transform spectrometer and the FTS data
analysis program <b>xgremlin</b> (from version 3 onwards) write data
files in FITS (Flexible Image Transfer System) format.  <b>
fits2nso</b> converts data files in FITS format to NSO type 6 format
so they can be read by J. W. Brault's <b> Gremlin </b> program.  <b>
xgremlin</b> can read files in FITS format directly.  <b> fits2nso
</b> creates a header (.hdr) and data (.dat) file pair and keeps the
original FITS file by default.  <p>

<h3>Options:</h3>
<dl>
<dt> <b>-f</b>

<dd>the <b>fringe division ratio</b> is stored in a real valued
variable <b>fdr</b> in FITS files from the NIST FTS. In NSO type data
files the fringe divsion ratio is stored as the ratio <b> M/K</b> of
two integer variables <b> M</b> and <b>K</b>.  By default,
<b>fits2nso</b> computes a pair of integer variables M and K with a
ratio very close to the fringe division ratio. If the
<b> -f</b> switch is used the variable <b>fdr</b> is stored in the
header file instead of M and K. This is useful and may be a little bit
more accurate if the header / data file pair is to be read with
<b>xgremlin</b> which can read the <b>fdr</b> variable in NSO type 6
data files.

<dt> <b>-h</b>
<dd> creates a header file only which can be used together with the
existing FITS file. Note that the data file must have the extension .dat for
<b>Gremlin</b>.

<dt> <b>-r</b>
<dd> <b>renames</b> the FITS file into a file with extension .dat so that it can be
used together with the header file.
</dl>
<p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<kbd> fits2nso -r *.fits </kbd><br><br>

will convert all FITS data files in the current directory
in NSO type 6 header- and data file pairs. The original FITS
files will be renamed in the process.
