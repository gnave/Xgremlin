<h1>Introduction</h1>

Gremlin is a spectral analysis program that is designed for the analysis
of FTS data. It has evolved from two other programs -- grammy and
<a href="../tutorial/references.html#decomp">
decomp</a>, and was written by Jim Brault 
It is used to 
Fourier transform interferograms, plot spectra, phase, intensity, and
wavenumber correct them, subtract a continuum if present, and find and fit
the spectral lines. It can also be used to construct synthetic spectra,
compare several different spectra, and eliminate ringing around lines.
<p>
Gremlin exists in several incarnations, including gremrun, gremlin,
and gremlet. The most recent addition is the program Xgremlin which is
a port of gremlin to PCs and workstations with a graphical user
interface based on the X Window System, Version 11 (X11). X11 is
independent of any particular computer hardware and is universally
used on workstations and PCs running Unix or a Unix--like operating
system. Other operating systems such as OS/2 or Windows NT also
support X11. One of the main reasons for the creation of Xgremlin was
the desire to have a version of gremlin that is no longer tied to some
particular computer hardware or operating system.  Xgremlin is fully
compatible to gremlin with the exception of some recent hardware
dependent additions to gremlin for spectrometer control.
<p>
This document is intended to give you a guide to what Xgremlin can
do and how to use it to transform and analyse spectra from an FTS. It
is by no means complete, but is intended to get you going.
