<H1> Using Xgremlin with non-FT spectra</A></H1>
<P>
We have recently been using Xgremlin successfully with spectra obtained on
grating instruments. Even from high resolution instruments there are
normally many fewer points for a typical run than from an FTS, so the
easiest way of getting the data into Xgremlin is usually by making an ASCII
file, similar to the one described in section 
<A HREF="quick_look.html">'A first quick look at your spectrum</A>, which
you can read into Xgremlin with the  <A HREF="../commands/run.html">
<b>run </b></a> command. After that, all the
commands used in single buffers, such as 
<A HREF="../commands/findlines.html"><b>findlines</b></a>
<A HREF="../commands/lsqfit.html"><b>lsqfit</b></a>,
<A HREF="../commands/writeparams.html"><b>writeparams</b> </a>
etc.  will work successfully 
<P>
One problem we have discovered in using Xgremlin with non-FT spectra is
that the lineshape from a grating instrument is often not a pure Voigt
profile. Since this is the only profile fitted by 
<A HREF="../commands/lsqfit.html"><b>lsqfit</b></a>, it may
be the case that you get the best wavelengths by either taking the
peak of the profile (by simply setting a marker there and pressing 
<A HREF="../plotmode.html">
'a'</a>)
 or the centre of gravity (by setting two markers either side of the
line and pressing
<A HREF="../plotmode.html">
 &lt;Ctrl+g&gt;</a>)  . We have found the best
wavelengths from  noticeably asymmetric lines from the 10.7 m normal
incidence grating spectrometer at N.I.S.T. are obtained by taking the
peak of the profile rather than the centre of gravity.
