<H1>Composing Good HTML</H1>

<P> This document attempts to address stylistic points of HTML composition,
both at the document and the web level.

<HR>

<P> <STRONG>New:</STRONG> This is version 2.0; <A HREF="old/">version
1 is still available</A> for those who are interested. Now that
<CITE><A HREF="http://www.aw.com/devpress/titles/48959.html">Web
Weaving</A></CITE> is on shelves near you, it seems appropriate for me
to get off my duff and feed all of the changes back into this
document. See "Some History," below, for more information on what the
heck I'm talking about.

<HR>

<P> This document is divided into two main sections. The first section
discusses the document -- it should be recognizable as the revised
version of the original CGH. It discusses good practices to follow
in creating your documents, common errors and things to avoid
when composing HTML, and finally, a brief treatment style sheets,
which provide a mechanism for greater control over how a document
is rendered. The second section is brand new -- it discusses style
issues regarding your Web as a whole. How it is divided and organized,
how it is interlinked and intertwined; these are the issues under
consideration here.

<P>This is not a beginner's guide; check the <A
HREF="#for_more_info">"For More Information"</A> section for pointers
to more basic works, as well as for more advanced references and
tutorials. It is designed for HTML author who has learned the basics,
and is ready to start thinking about the more advanced aspects of Web
document design.

<P> <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> I'm not finished spiffing up this new
version yet, but it's good enough to be presentable, and I'd rather
have the information available, rather than have it languish for lack
of final polishing. At the very least, I still need to:

<UL>
<LI>Make some of the larger figures into a more manageable size
<LI>Provide rendered versions of the HTML examples
<LI>Add in some more useful links to other resources (suggestions
appreciated!)
<LI>Break this into single and multipart versions by preparing
<A HREF="multiview/">multiview</A> source documents
</UL>

<P> Unfortunately, the life of grad student is not all cheese and wine
(very little of it, in fact), so these will have to come at a later
date. Besides, the imminent publication of <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE>
(see the History section below for background) seems an appropriate
time to also re-update this document, so I won't let a little thing
like a busy schedule stand in my way.

<H2><A NAME="some_history">Some History</A></H2>

<P> I wrote the first version of "Composing Good HTML" in January of
1994. At this point, the Web was just starting to explode, and Mosaic
was the browser on the tip of everyone's mouse. Being one of the
strange few who used <A
HREF="http://www.ukans.edu/about_lynx/about_lynx.html">Lynx</A> as
well as <A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A>
(as well as <A
HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">Emacs-W3</A>, when
I was feeling cocky), I noticed that different browsers dealt with
incorrect usage of HTML with varying degrees of success.  When I
pointed this out, the solution suggested to me was to write a "lint"
for HTML that would point out common errors in documents. In
preparation for this, I started making a list of common errors, and
turned that list into a human-readable document.  That document became
"Composing Good HTML."

<P> About that time the semester started, so I made the document
publicly available, and asked for comments and criticism. I got both,
in spades! I corrected errors (including a plethora of spelling and
grammatical errors), added some new sections, and revised pieces of
existing sections. But, all in all, CGH didn't really change much,
even though things like <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html3/CoverPage.html">HTML
3.0</A> (let alone <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/faq2.html">Java</A>
and <A HREF="http://vrml.wired.com/">VRML</A>) have snuck up in the
meantime.

<P> In January of 1995, Carl Steadman, Tyler Jones, and I got together
with the idea of writing a book about the Web (this was before the
current explosion of the market, so you'll pardon our naivete).
Rather than writing a book about HTML, we decided to write a book
about creating and maintaining an entire site -- including the
stylistic points in CGH as a starting point. The book is called
<CITE>Web Weaving</CITE>, and it will be coming out from
Addison-Wesley on December 18th.

<P> The side effect of all of this is that it gave me a reason to
revise CGH to reflect current practices for inclusion in <CITE>Web
Weaving</CITE>. And now that we've finally finished our book, this
also means that the changes in CGH are getting fed right back into the
online version. Which, I'm proud to say, is still freely available
(and better than ever, I'd like to think). What you see here is, by
and large, Chapters 11 and 12 from <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE>, edited it
so that they stand alone better. While I'd certainly recommend you
read <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE> for a full treatment on all the issues
involved in building and maintaining your Web site (and because every
author hopes that his words will be read), Composing Good HTML remains
(I hope!) a useful resource for HTML authors (and now Web designers)
who want a slightly more sophisticated treatment of the stylistic
issues involved in, well, weaving your web.

<P> I never did get around to writing that "lint" program, though.

<H1><A NAME="document_style_considerations">Document Style Considerations</A></H1>


<P> The World Wide Web has been a wildly successful experiment. It has
filled a need for both information users and for information
providers: a tool which allows information to be deployed to a wide
variety of people over wide geographic distances, regardless of what
kind of computer they may be running. All that is required to publish
information is any one of a number of Web servers, and all that is
required to view that information is any one of a number of Web
clients. This is both an opportunity and a challenge.  This document
discusses the ways in which you construct your markup so that it is
readable and usable for a wide range of browsers.

<P> HTML provides a device-independent way of describing information.
The elements of HTML describe <EM>what</EM> your information is, not
<EM>how</EM> it should be displayed. This is a subtle point,
and perhaps the most important one presented here. HTML will let you
describe this piece of information as a header, or that piece of
information as an address. It will not let you describe this text as
being in 24-point Helvetica, right justified. Your challenge is to
provide professional page layout and design <EM>without</EM> using the
traditional tools of professional page layout and design.  Sound like
a paradox? Not really. All it involves is a bit of trust.

<P> The trust you must have can be summarized by the following rule:

<UL>
<LI><EM>if</EM> you mark up a document so that your information
is labeled as what it is instead of as how it should be displayed,
<LI><EM>then</EM> browsers will render it in a way that is appropriate
and professional-looking.
</UL>

<P> With the current diversity of clients for the Web (and we can only
expect to see more), it has become important to write HTML that will
look good on any client, and not just on the specific client which the
author may have access to. You must trust your markup. There is no way
to anticipate how every browser will (differently) render your
HTML. If you follow this rule you will get the best possible rendering
with all browsers, instead of for just one browser.

<P> To this end, there are a few solutions. One approach is software
based -- a "lint"-like program for catching semantic errors in HTML,
and perhaps even correcting them. Two good examples of this are <A
HREF="http://www.webtechs.com/html-val-svc/">WebTech's HTML Validation
Service</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.khoros.unm.edu/staff/neilb/weblint.html">WebLint</A>.
Another approach is the one taken by this document -- a style guide
which points out common errors one might make in the composition of
HTML, and recommending good practices to follow.

<P> Bear in mind when following these guidelines that your document
may not end up looking the best it possibly can on a particular
browser. However, it also will not look ugly on any browser, which is
the risk you take by disregarding these recommendations and tweaking
your markup code for, say, <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>.  Unfortunately,
Netscape may render things differently from <A
HREF="http://www.ukans.edu/about_lynx/about_lynx.html">Lynx</A> which
may render things differently from <A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A>,
and so on and so forth -- and even within a particular browser, a user
may have chosen font or style preferences different from the ones
which you might assume. What these guidelines should do, if followed,
is make for a better presentation for the most browsers (instead of
the best presentation for only one) -- and ensure that your documents
reach the widest audience possible.

<H2><A NAME="good_practices">Good Practices</A></H2>

<P> Things contained in this section are good practices for the
generation of any HTML document. Specifically, this would include
anything which should routinely be done in the creation of documents
for the benefit of both reader and author.

<H3><A NAME="using_non_standard_html">How to Use Non-Standard
HTML</A></H3>

<P> There are at least three major flavors of HTML currently in
practice as this is being written: <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/">HTML 2.0</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html3/CoverPage.html">HTML
3.0</A>, and the <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions.html">Netscape
extensions to HTML 2.0</A>.  HTML 2.0 is the closest thing to current
practice that is available, and can be assumed to be "safe" for all
browsers.

<P> On the other hand, the HTML 3.0 and the Netscape extensions are
not widely implemented, let alone standardized. Under most circumstances,
this would be a good reason not to use them until they were more
widely available, but there is the mitigating circumstance that
all of the Netscape extensions (and some of HTML 3.0, most notably
tables) are supported by one of the most popular Web browsers
. . . Netscape!

<P> What should be done about this? Many Web authors take the approach
that, since most people use Netscape, it's acceptable to use the
Netscape elements, even if it is to the detriment of people using
other browsers. Others take the approach that nothing more than
HTML 2.0 should ever be used, which means that any benefit which
might be derived from these enhancements is lost.

<P> The best road is a middle approach. Two good rules of thumb are:

<UL>

<LI>If two or more popular browsers support the extension, it's
probably fine to use. For instance, both <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A>
(and <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Arena/">Arena</A>) now support
tables, so any tables you use will be available to most of your
audience.

<LI>If the extension is not widely supported, but it will not
adversely affect your document if it is missing, it's probably
fine to use. For instance, the <CODE>FONT</CODE> element changes
the font size of text in the Netscape Navigator, but not in any
other client. However, other clients will simply <I>ignore</I>
tags they do not understand-so the text in the <CODE>FONT</CODE>
element will still be readable. On the other hand, if the <CODE>MATH</CODE>
element is ignored by a browser, the browser will display gibberish.

</UL>


<P> In general, try to think about the effect that the non-standard
elements will have if they are not recognized. These elements
can be used intelligently, and on browsers that recognize them,
can dramatically enhance the presentation of your page. If it
is not possible to use the elements in such a way that rendering
is still good on all clients, think about providing multiple copies
of the document (for instance, providing a version of the table
using the <CODE>PRE</CODE> element), and possibly using content-negotiation
on the server to provide the reader with the correct version of
the document.

<P> A final thought on the subject: try to avoid banners in your document
that claim that your document is "Enhanced for Netscape"
or "Enhanced for HTML 3.0" (or the rapidly more prevalent
"Enhanced for Microsoft's Internet Explorer." Ugh.)
Rather, try to build your document so that if a reader reads it
in (for example) Netscape, it will be obvious that it uses the
new elements to good effect . . . and if a reader reads it in
another browser, they can remain blissfully unaware of what they
cannot see, and still be impressed by what they do see.

<P> (<STRONG>Opinion Alert:</STRONG> a general comment, that may or
may not place me on Bill Gates' hit list -- while I have a healthy
disregard for the cavalier attitude in which most "extensions" are
made de facto by overwhelming will of places like Netscape, I still
have a healthy respect for those extensions which attempt to solve an
important problem in a useful way. Many of the Netscape extensions,
especially those involving tables, fit this bill, and while they did
also provide many duds as well, they have also supported the valid
HTML 3.0 alternatives that mirror their extensions.  However, in my
opinion, every single one of the <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/iexplorer.htm">"Microsoft
extensions"</A> is of dubious merit, and of certain incompatibility
with any evolving HTML 3.0 specification. Given the well developed
state of HTML 3.0, introducing new and incompatible methods of doing
the same thing is irresponsible at the least. I highly recommend
simply disregarding the extensions introduced with Internet Explorer.
Please note that I have the highest respect for many of Microsoft's
products; I even used Word and Internet Assistant to compose this
edition of this document [although I edited the HTML afterward].  And,
dear reader, this paragraph in particular is highly opinion-ridden, so
you must take it with a grain of salt as you see fit. On with the
useful stuff:)

<H3><A NAME="signing_and_timestamping_docs">Signing and time-stamping
documents</A></H3>

<P> One problem which faces anyone trying to find information using
the Internet is the question of "authoritativeness."  The relative
ease with which WWW servers can be set up and populated with
information means that the traditional checks of the publishing
process can not act to filter out information which is inaccurate or
misleading. In addition, it can often be hard to tell how current
information found online is, or how actively it is maintained and
updated.

<P> One thing which you can do to assist Web users is to sign and
date all documents in your infostructure, so that people viewing
the documents can form some impression of the authority of the
document (i.e., how recent it is, and how reliable the information
provider is). This is not a complete solution, but it is a large
step forward.

<P> For example:

<PRE>
&lt;HR&gt;
Last modified: March 6, 1995
&lt;ADDRESS&gt;
&lt;A HREF="http://cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/"&gt;James Eric Tilton&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;A HREF="mailto:tilt@cs.cmu.edu"&gt;tilt@cs.cmu.edu&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;
</PRE>

<P> Some notes about this example:

<UL>
<LI>The date is given in an unambiguous format: "March 6,
1995". Why is this better than the more economical "3/6/95"?
One reason is that for some of your audience, especially those
from Europe, this means "June 3, 1995".

<LI>A link to a home page is provided. If a reader is interested, she
can follow it to find more information by this author.  This provides
a consistent centering function which helps keep a reader from
becoming disoriented (See <CITE><A HREF="#scenic_path">Main Roads and
Scenic Paths</A></CITE>, below).

<LI>A <CODE>mailto:</CODE> link anchors the document to the mail
address of its creator. The <CODE>mailto:</CODE> URL specifies
an e-mail address. Most browsers support this, allowing the reader
to send e-mail to the address specified. This can be a useful
way to get feedback. In addition, the <CODE>mailto:</CODE> link
is separated from the link to the home page by a <CODE>&lt;BR&gt;</CODE>,
so that the two links can be easily distinguished.
</UL>


<P> Another option for signing a document is to encode information
about the author in the document's header information. You can do this
by including a <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.2.4">LINK</A>
element of type <CODE>made</CODE> in your <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HEAD.html">HEAD</A>
element. For example:

<PRE>
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;This is my Title&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;LINK REV="made" HREF="mailto:author@some.site.org"&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
</PRE>

<P> This example uses the <CODE>LINK</CODE> element, which may be
unfamiliar to you. This element is equivalent to the <CODE>A</CODE>
element; that is, it provides a link to some other object. However,
since it is part of the <CODE>HEAD</CODE> information (which is
information <EM>about</EM> the document, rather than part of the
document  itself), this is a link from the <STRONG>entire</STRONG>
document to another object. (Anchors, on the other hand, are links
from some small subset of the document, like a word or a phrase,
to another document). This link, like most other <CODE>HEAD</CODE>
information, is typically not displayed by a browser,  or followable
by a reader.

<P> The fact that it is not displayed does not make it useless,
however.  Many browsers, such as <A
HREF="http://www.ukans.edu/about_lynx/about_lynx.html">Lynx</A>,
supply a "reply to author" function. The information about who the
author is comes from using the <CODE>LINK</CODE> as above. Other
applications which can make use of the information include Web spiders
and other maintenance tools, which can benefit from having authority
information in machine readable format.

<P> The format of the <CODE>LINK</CODE> element is the same as that
of the <CODE>A</CODE> element. Notice the use of the <CODE>REV</CODE>
attribute, which describes this relationship as a <CODE>REV</CODE>erse
relationship of the type <CODE>made</CODE>. This means that this
document was made by the object at the other end of the anchor.

<H3><A NAME="device_independence">Device independence through
better printing</A></H3>

<P> One promise of the wide-spread availability of personal computers
has been the lessening of our reliance on paper. In some ways,
this promise has been realized; many trees (and municipal landfills)
are no doubt grateful that many of us are now committing our words
to e-mail instead of to a handwritten or typewritten letter or
memo. On the other hand, until video display technology produces
results indistinguishable from paper, we will no doubt continue
to print out things. It's hard to curl up with a notebook
at night, especially if it has a coaxial cable jutting out the
back of it. Because of this, many people will want to print out
the documents which you have provided electronically. In effect,
they will want to take the document you have woven into a part
of a web, and make it into a standalone document.

<P> Fortunately, HTML is well-suited to this. A document in HTML can
theoretically be rendered in many more formats besides simply
on a screen. Print is one obvious alternative, although speech
and Braille are also possible and desirable. We bring this up
because it is important to consider ways other than on-screen
that a reader may encounter your documents. Given that, thinking
about your document as something that might be printed can be
a very useful tool for creating documents that aren't tied
to the specific requirements of a browser or display hardware.

<H3><A NAME="using_prose">Taking advantage of prose</A></H3>

<P> One of the advantages of the World Wide Web over similar infosystems,
like Gopher, is that the Web makes no distinction between what
is a menu and what is a document. For instance, in Gopher, a document
is "dead" -- it can't lead anywhere, and, in
order to continue exploration, a reader must return one step back
to a menu. In the same vein, a Gopher menu provides only limited
information about where links to lead to: often a menu item must
be retrieved and explored before any sense can be made of whether
it is appropriate to what a reader seeks.

<P> On the other hand, a Web document is "live" -- there's
no clear dividing line between a menu container and its contents.
This is a liberating distinction, as a document can now be as
verbose as necessary in providing context for links. Consider
the difference between these two documents in Figures 1 and
2.

<HR>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig1.html">[Figure 1: A menu list
without context (Lynx)]</A>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig2.html">[Figure 2: A prose
description of resources (Lynx)]</A>

<HR>

<P> The second example is much more satisfying, because it is more
than simply a list of pointers. Instead, an effort has been made
to integrate the list into prose that is (presumably) better tied
into the subject of the document as a whole.

<P> This is not to say that it is always preferable to force what
is more naturally a menu into prose for the sake of prose. If
you are creating a document that serves as an jumping-off point
to other resources, your readers might not want to get into the
thick of text to find the resource they're searching for.
In this case, a definition list may be more appropriate, as shown
in Figure 3. This is a nice compromise, giving context without
becoming buried in a forest of words.

<HR>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig3.html">[Figure 3: A menu using
a definition list (Lynx)]</A>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="meaningless_link_text">Meaningless link text</A></H3>

<P> When creating documents, make sure that your links are meaningful
-- that is, that they avoid online-specific references, and that they
don't detract from readability. The text of your links should flow
well in the context of the rest of your text , and your text should
also be able to stand alone as a printable document . You should at
all costs avoid the "<A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html">Click
Here</A>" syndrome, as shown in Figure 4.

<HR>

<P ALIGN="center"> 
<A HREF="figures/fig4.html">[Figure 4, The "Click Here" Syndrome (Arena)]</A>

<HR>

<P> Figure 4 is also bad because it refers to "clicking",
which assumes that everyone is using a mouse with their browser,
which is not always the case. A much better alternative is demonstrated
in figure 5.

<HR>

<P ALIGN="center"> 
<A HREF="figures/fig5.html">[Figure 5, Meaningful Link Text (Arena)]</A>

<HR>

<P> Another point to consider about the choice of words selected for
link text ("information about cows", in this example),
is that often this link text may be what is used as information
for a reader's bookmark or hotlist entry. When the word "here"
is used as link text, the hotlist may become cluttered with entries
that read only, "here", instead with information about
what the link is actually about.

<H3><A NAME="using_outlining">Organization through outlining</A></H3>

<P> Headers provide a useful way to provide an outline for your document.
Headers of level 1 (<CODE>H1</CODE>) indicate major points, while
headers of level 2 (<CODE>H2</CODE>) provide sub-topics to those
points, and so on and so forth. It is important to remember that
the purpose of these headers is not to provide specific kinds
of fonts or layout, but rather to organize a document into section.
To that end, here are some recommendations about heading usage:

<UL>
<LI>A heading should not be more then one level below the heading
which preceded it. That is, an <CODE>H3</CODE> element should
not follow an <CODE>H1</CODE> element directly.
<LI>Also, one version of the HTML specification declares that
"a heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph
breaks before and after, and white space (for example) necessary
to render the heading". Extra highlighting elements are discouraged
within the header, like <CODE>EM</CODE> or <CODE>B</CODE>.
<LI>Do not markup text as <CODE>H2</CODE> or <CODE>H3</CODE>,
simply because it provides the correct size and bolding of fonts
on the browsers used by local readers. On another browser, that
same text may be incredibly grotesque and large, not providing
the desired effect at all. Figures 6 and 7 demonstrate this
effect.
</UL>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="physical_vs_logical">Physical versus logical character
emphasis</A></H3>

<P> Since HTML (and also SGML) is designed to be a device independent
language for describing the content of documents, most of the elements
within it aren't intended to give direct control to the author over
how the final page layout will look. The major exceptions to this are
in the character highlighting elements.

<P> There are two types of <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.7">character
highlighting</A> elements -- physical and logical. The physical styles
involve things like "italic font", and "boldface"; while the logical
styles are things like "emphasis", "citation", and "strong." It is
strongly recommended that you employ the logical styles rather than
the physical styles in your documents. Using the <CODE>I</CODE>
element to render text in italics will only be effective on those
browsers which are capable of displaying italics -- which all browsers
are not guaranteed to be able to do. It is far better to encode
semantic content -- to describe things in terms of logical styles --
and then allow the browser to display that semantic structure as best
it can, given its display capabilities.

<P> So, instead of

<PRE>
&lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;
</PRE>

<P> you might use

<PRE>
&lt;EM&gt;emphasized&lt;/EM&gt;
</PRE>

<P> or a

<PRE>
&lt;CITE&gt;citation&lt;/CITE&gt;
</PRE>

<P> and instead of

<PRE>
&lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;
</PRE>

<P> you might use

<PRE>
&lt;STRONG&gt;strong&lt;/STRONG&gt;
</PRE>

<P> This also leaves the possibilities open in the future for more
sophisticated uses of these semantic encoding, which have much
more inherent meaning than font styles like bold or italic. For
example, the <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos indexing system</A>
can take advantage of semantic encoding to create abstracts of
documents.

<P> <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Before you stop using <CODE>B</CODE> and
<CODE>I</CODE> altogether, here's another viewpoint to consider.
One argument against logical character styles is that it turns
out to be a bottomless pit, a fruitless attempt to define logical
styles for every possibility. Physical styles, combined with the
context of the text in which they are placed, seem to provide
a much richer set without a huge number of tags. Consider the
large space of context that can be implied with only the typographical
conventions of <B>bold</B> or <I>italic</I>. The only problem
is that that contextual space needs to have a human being to interpret
it, which would make some kinds of computer-based rendering difficult,
if not impossible (e.g. speech synthesis).

<H3><A NAME="using_pictures">A picture is worth a thousand words
(which is why it takes a thousand times longer to load...)</A>
</H3>

<P> The title of this section is somewhat facetious, but only somewhat.
It's more and more obvious from current Web development efforts
that the main attraction of the Web is not hypertext, and it's
not an easy interface; the main attraction is the flashy graphics
and the alluring promise of multimedia. We shall heroically refrain
from commenting on whether this is a good or a bad thing, for
the fact remains that online multimedia is here to stay. What
we <EM>will</EM> comment on is on the issues that must be considered
to use multimedia for best effect.

<P> The first set of issues revolves about the faux sense of page
design one can get by using inline images. An early example of
this was one of the early commercial forays into the Web, a graphic
design house which advertised professional layout services for
online brochures. They spent quite a bit of time designing graphics
images of the proper width so that they could achieve page-layout
effects like right justification and centering, and created a
page which was fairly well-designed. However, they got bitten
because this design relied on a browser's window being the default
width for <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">X Mosaic</A>.
With a wider window, the carefully aligned logo in the upper right
corner was immediately followed by the image that should have
been on left justified on the following line.

<P> Current browsers implement some better forms of layout control
for images. For example, an author can specify the way in which
text will flow around an image with an <CODE>ALIGN</CODE> element.
Figures 8 and 9 exemplify this; the former has no text-flow
information, and the latter does. This is not perfect, as using
the <CODE>ALIGN</CODE> tag can cause strange stair-stepping effects
if there is not enough text separating two images, as figure 10
illustrates. If the desired effect is of images with captions,
a table is probably the best approach for layout purposes (Figure
11).

<HR>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig8.html">[Figure 8: IMG without
the ALIGN element (Netscape)]</A>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig9.html">[Figure 9: IMG with the
ALIGN element (Netscape)]</A>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig10.html">[Figure 10:
Stair-stepping due to ALIGN (Netscape)]</A>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig11.html">[Figure 11: Using
TABLE for layout (Netscape)]</A>

<HR>

<P> Another consideration is the reduplication of effort. Many authors
swear by colored bullets and colorful horizontal rules, implementing
both effects by using inlined images rather than the structural
markup. Doing this can leave the portion of your audience which
is unable (or unwilling) to view inlined images out of the loop,
and can also negate some of the benefits provided by structural
markup. There is also an unexpected side effect to using many
small images: the current way in which Web clients retrieve documents
requires that a separate connection to a Web server be initiated
for each image. The time involved in negotiating this connection
may actually be larger than the time involved in retrieving the
image itself. Consider whether the effect achieved by the "enhanced"
layout justifies the cost.

<P> Another concern is the size of images. With the increasing home
popularity of the Internet, more and more users are purchasing
dial-up connections of one sort or another. This may be of the
strict "shell-account" variety, which means that your
readers will not see images at all, or they may be of the SLIP/PPP
variety, which means that your readers will have an average of
only 14,400 bits of information per second sent to them. This
is not a large number, and huge images can take minutes to load.
Bear this in mind when selecting images; will the image take so
long to load that your reader will go somewhere else rather than
wait?

<P> The image size issue can be alleviated in several ways. First, the
increasing popularity of the <A
HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/jpeg-faq/top.html">JPEG
format</A> means that images can be compressed to much smaller sizes,
which provides dramatic speed-up in image load time. Even better
results can be achieved by using less colors (gray scale, rather than
full 24-bit color, for example). Another approach is to use a small
set of navigational icons which appear on every page in your Web. Most
browsers now cache documents and images; using the same icons (and
using the <I>same</I> URL to refer to them with, perhaps by
maintaining an <CODE>/icons</CODE> directory on your Web server) means
that the reader will only incur the cost of downloading once.

<P> Also, when using the <CODE>IMG</CODE> element, be aware of the
<CODE>ALT</CODE> attribute. The <CODE>ALT</CODE> attribute allows
alternate text to be specified for an inlined image. This is especially
useful for images that have specific meaning (and provide a link
to other documents), as that meaning can be lost on those who
do not have images loaded. For example:

<PRE>
&lt;IMG SRC="http://www.miskatonic.edu/icons/next.gif"&gt;
</PRE>

<P> can be better represented with the addition of the following ALT
attribute:

<PRE>
&lt;IMG SRC="http://www.miskatonic.edu/icons/next.gif" ALT="[Next Page]"&gt;
</PRE>

<P> as shown in figures 12 through 16.

<HR>

<P> Finally, don't rely entirely on image maps and graphic logos to
build your site. There are a few sites which have almost no textual
content whatsoever; when visited by readers who do not (or cannot)
load images, there is no information available. This is not to
say that image maps must be avoided altogether. Instead, provide
alternate means of navigation which supplement the image map,
such as explanatory text which follows your map.

<H2><A NAME="common_errors">Common Errors</A></H2>

<P> This section details common errors in HTML composition, that may
lead to documents which are not fully device-independent. The
behaviors of these errors are undefined, so certain browsers may
render them as intended but not all browsers are guaranteed of
doing so. Therefore, these mistakes should be avoided, even if
your browser of choice renders your documents correctly.

<P> These errors are, for the most part, artifacts of "raw"
HTML authoring. Web development has suffered from a lack of good
authoring tools, a situation which is only now beginning to be
rectified. Many of these errors involve typos or simple mistakes,
although others deal with more fundamental conceptual problems.

<H3><A NAME="paragraph_element_errors">Paragraph element errors</A></H3>

<P> The use of the paragraph element (<A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.5.1">P</A>)
can be confusing. When HTML was first introduced,
<CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> served as a paragraph separator, not as an
end-of-paragraph; a confusion which originally prompted this
doucment. However, more recent version of the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/">HTML 2.0 and later
specifications</A> have changed this behaviour.

<P> The current recommended use of the P element is to be placed at
the <EM>beginning</EM> of paragraphs; for example: 

<PRE>
&lt;P&gt; In this paragraph, our hero discovers that he really likes
baloney sandwiches. He also listens to some disco, and has a
lovely beverage. Ah, if only all paragraphs were this exciting!
</PRE>

<P> This is in contrast to previous usage, where the <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE>
was usually placed at the end of the paragraph. 

<P> Still, in certain contexts, use of <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> should
be avoided, such as directly before any other element which already
implies a paragraph break.

<P> To wit, the <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> element should not be placed
before the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.4">headings</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.9">HR</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.5.3">ADDRESS</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.5.4">BLOCKQUOTE</A>,
or <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.5.2">PRE</A>.

<P> It should also not be placed immediately before a <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.6">list
element</A> of any stripe. That is, a &lt;P&gt; should not be used to
mark the end-of-text for <CODE>&lt;LI&gt;</CODE>,
<CODE>&lt;DT&gt;</CODE> or <CODE>&lt;DD&gt;</CODE>. These elements
already imply paragraph breaks.

<H4><A NAME="paragraph_errors">Caveats</A></H4>

<P> Some clarifications on the above might be in order. One is the
difficulties of rendering appropriate white space by a browser.  While
it is true that all of the entities mentioned above imply a paragraph
break, this only occasionally means that they also imply white space
between sections -- this depends on the browser.  So, while you might
feel inclined to add a <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> in order to fix white
space problems, please think twice and avoid it if you can.

<P> Also, when using the glossary list (<A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.6.5">DL</A>),
please try to avoid using multiple DDs (definitions of terms) in order
to provide multiple entries for a term (DT). Instead, use a
<CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> tag between paragraphs in a definition.

<P> All clear now?

<H3><A NAME="reference_errors">Character and entity reference
errors</A></H3>

<P> Simply put, a <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_3.html#SEC3.2.1">character
reference and an entity reference</A> are ways to represent
information that might otherwise be interpreted as a markup tag. For
example, consider the rendered HTML document in figure 17.

<HR>

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig17.html">[Figure 17: Properly
escaping character entities (Arena)]</A>

<HR>

<P> The source which produces this document, which uses entities,
looks like:

<PRE>
In order to represent the &amp;quot;&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&amp;quot; in this text, I had to use &amp;amp;lt;P&amp;amp;gt; in my raw HTML.
</PRE>

<P> In this example, the <CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE> becomes "&lt;", the
<CODE>&amp;gt;</CODE> becomes "&gt;", the <CODE>&amp;quot;</CODE>
becomes a quotation mark, and the <CODE>&amp;amp;</CODE> becomes
"&amp;" (which is needed in order to represent the text
<CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE> in the document without the text being turned
into "&lt;"). There are currently <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_9.html#SEC9.7.1">four
entities for this purpose in HTML</A>, as well as several entities
which allow encoding of the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_9.html#SEC9.7.2">ISO
Latin-1 Character Set</A>.

<P> The most common error in the use of entities is to leave off the
trailing semicolon. Also, no additional spaces are needed before or
after the entity/character reference. Here are some examples of
incorrect usage:

<PRE>
Doug &amp;amp Chris went out for a walk.
A paragraph break can be represented with
&amp;quote; &amp;gt; P &amp;lt; &amp;quote;
</PRE>

<P> Can you spot the errors in the above examples? They are:

<UL>
<LI>In the first line, "<CODE>&amp;amp</CODE>" needs
have a semicolon after it.
<LI>In the third line, "<CODE>&amp;quote;</CODE>" should
be <CODE>&amp;quot;</CODE> (this is subtle and annoying, much
like the Unix system call, <CODE>creat()</CODE>)
<LI>There should be no spaces in the third line, which should
read: <CODE>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;P&amp;lt;&amp;quot;</CODE>.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="url_errors">URL errors</A></H3>

<P> Another misunderstood aspect of Web document composition is in the
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">creation of
URLs</A>.

<H4><A NAME="directory_errors">Directory reference errors</A>
</H4>

<P> One grey area involves references to directories. It is possible
to request an index of a directory from an HTTP server. The typical
response from the server is to either return a pre-generated index
document (which is often the document "index.html" in
the referenced directory), or to construct an HTML document on
the fly which contains a listing of all files in the directory.
However, when making such a directory reference, it is important
to make sure to have a trailing slash on the URL. That is, if
you were to request the index of Willamette University's directory
of HTML documentation, you would want to refer to it as <A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/">http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/</A>,
not as <A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition">http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition</A>.

<P> Many servers are able to catch these errors, and provide redirection
to the proper URL, but it's best to get the URL right in the first
place -- notably because not all browsers support transparent
redirection. Also, getting this correct the first time means it
will take less time for the page to be loaded; your readers won't have
to wait through the time needed to open two (or more) HTTP connections.

<H4><A NAME="fqdn_errors">Not using fully qualified domain names</A></H4>

<P> Problems can arise when the hostnames in URLs aren't fully
qualified. Within a local network, a machine can often be simply
referred to by its host name. For example, the domain
<CODE>miskatonic.edu</CODE> might have in it a WWW server with the
host name <CODE>www</CODE>.  Readers within that domain can refer to
the machine by this name.  However, the server's fully qualified
domain name is <CODE>www.miskatonic.edu</CODE>.  This fully qualified
domain name provides enough information that any host, anywhere on the
Internet, can find this particular machine.

<P> What happens is that an HTML author might construct a link that
looks like this:

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF="http://www/~tilt/metanoia/"&gt;Metanoia -- A Change In Spirit&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>


<P> which produces a link to "<A
HREF="http://www/~tilt/metanoia/">Metanoia-A Change In Spirit</A>"
that will only work for people in the local network which that machine
is on. A correct link would look like this, instead:

<PRE> &lt;A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/metanoia/"&gt;Metanoia -- A Change In Spirit&lt;/A&gt; </PRE>

<P> which would allow all of the readers who are interested in <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/metanoia/">Metanoia</A> -- even
those living in <A HREF="http://www.freedonia.com/">Freedonia</A> -- to
actually follow the link.

<P> Along those same lines, be careful in using URLs of the scheme
"<CODE>file:</CODE>". It's possible to have a reference
to <CODE>file://localhost/some/file/pathname</CODE>. What this
does is references the file described on the local host of whoever
is browsing the document. Which is why a reference to <CODE>&lt;A
HREF="file://localhost/etc/motd"&gt;the message of the
day&lt;/A&gt;</CODE> will display the message of the day on your
machine, not the message of the day on my machine. However, this
makes several assumptions about your reader's local machine
and network which you probably shouldn't be making. Unless
you know what you are doing (and probably even then), references
of this type will really mess up your Web.

<H3><A NAME="missing_quote_errors">Missing quotes in start tags</A></H3>

<P> One common error, especially with the current lack of widely
available and useful authoring tools, is to leave off a quote in the
attributes of tags. For example, this reference to the <A
HREF="/~tilt/euphonium/">euphonium, king of instruments</A>, should
look like:

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/euphonium/"&gt; 
</PRE>

<P> but people composing "raw" HTML from a text editor will often
instead type

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/euphonium/&gt; 
</PRE>

<P> It's likely that by the end of that huge URL, the author
had forgotten it was supposed to be quoted. The behavior of browsers
upon encountering this varies -- some display a proper link,
but you can't follow it, while others actually eat up huge portions
of the following text, thinking everything up until the next quotation
mark to be part of the URL.

<H3><A NAME="missed_end_tag_errors">Missed end tags</A></H3>

<P> Many of the HTML elements  contain information within them. For
example, <CODE>&lt;EM&gt;emphasized text&lt;/EM&gt;</CODE> would
be rendered as emphasized text. There is a start tag (<CODE>&lt;EM&gt;</CODE>),
some content (which may include text, and in some cases, other
nested elements), and an end tag (<CODE>&lt;/EM&gt;</CODE>, indicated
by the <CODE>&lt;/</CODE>). A common mistake is to miss the <CODE>/</CODE>
in the end tag. All elements (except empty elements, below) must
be terminated by an end tag -- otherwise, undefined behavior
may occur.

<P> Some HTML elements may be empty, such as <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE>
and <CODE>&lt;HR&gt;</CODE> (<A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/">the HTML 2.0
specification</A> provides <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_3.html#SEC3.2.2">more
information about element content</A>).  If this is the case, there is
no need for an end tag.

<H3><A NAME="using_white_space_around_tags">Using white space
around element tags</A></H3>

<P> In general, the use of white space around element tags should be
avoided. For example, if white space immediately follows a start tag,
the style changes implied by that element may be applied to the
initial space as well. For instance,

<PRE>
You really should
&lt;A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/"&gt; CZeCh THIZ 0uT &lt;/A&gt; !
</PRE>

<P> would be rendered in Netscape as shown in figure 18, and in
Lynx as shown in figure 19.

<HR> <P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig18.html">[Figure 18:

<P ALIGN="center"> <A HREF="figures/fig19.html">[Figure 19: Improper
use of whitespace (Lynx)]</A>

<HR>

<P> On some browsers, there may be white space around the anchor,
which adds unwanted unsightliness to the rendering, and may lessen
the impact of the document. (This comment really applies to white
space immediately following start tags, and immediately preceding
end tags).

<H2><A NAME="stylesheets">Stylesheets</A></H2>

<P> The point has probably been well made by now that HTML is not
a very good vehicle for providing specific information about layout
and presentation. There are no mechanisms for an author to specify
how she wants specific elements rendered, or to control aspects
of page layout. While one of the strengths of HTML is this very
independence from presentation details, it has become clear that
some form of presentation control is needed. 

<P> Stylesheets are the answer to this problem. It provides the other
half of the equation, the half that is currently not provided
by HTML. While HTML provides information about content, stylesheets
will provide information about how to render specific elements.

<P> Unfortunately, while several mechanisms for providing stylesheets
are under development, there is no clear standard at the time
of this writing. We cannot tell you what stylesheet mechanism(s)
will become standard, but we can tell you about the current contenders.
Keep your hopes up, though: because of the importance of stylesheets,
it is highly likely that a usable standard will emerge within
the next year.

<H3><A NAME="stylesheet_proposals">Some Stylesheet Proposals</A></H3>

<P> In these proposals, the stylesheets contain information about how
elements should be rendered, whether this is font information,
justification information, etc. At the time of this writing, the
syntax for these stylesheets has not yet been fully designed.

<H4><A NAME="cascading_style_sheets">Arena/Cascading Style Sheets</A></H4>

<P> The Arena browser is currently the only browser which supports
a stylesheet mechanism, and that mechanism is currently only very
limited and very experimental. The mechanism involves "<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style/css/draft">cascading style sheets</A>,"
which means that the several different style sheets, each with
a different order of importance, are combined in order of importance
to create a presentation style. The reader can specify her own
preferences for rendering, as can document authors, and these
preferences are merged to produce the final document.

<H4><A NAME="dsssl_lite">DSSSL/DSSSL Lite</A></H4>

<P> DSSSL is the Document Style Semantics and Specification Language,
which has emerged from the <A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/WebSGML.html">SGML</A>
community as a potential stylesheet mechanism. Because it is complex,
work is being done to create "<A
HREF="http://www.jclark.com/dsssl/">DSSSL Lite</A>," a modified subset
of DSSSL which can be easily implemented by client programmers, and
easily used by HTML authors.

<H3><A NAME="stylesheet_alternatives">Alternatives to Stylesheets</A></H3>


<P>While stylesheets are not currently useable, there are alternatives
in existing specifications, which can be used with existing browsers.
While the HTML 3.0 enhancements below are not yet widely propagated,
it is likely that they will be soon; and the Netscape enhancements are
already available (and are likely to be integrated into the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html3/CoverPage.html">evolving
HTML 3.0 specification</A>).

<H4><A NAME="html_30_page_layout">HTML 3.0</A></H4>

<P> While HTML 3.0 does include the <CODE>STYLE</CODE> element for
supporting whatever mechanism is eventually deployed for stylesheets,
HTML 3.0 also provides some new elements for greater control over
presentation. These elements include <CODE>BANNER</CODE>, <CODE>BIG</CODE>,
<CODE>SMALL</CODE>, <CODE>TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>MATH</CODE>, and
<CODE>TAB</CODE>.

<P> The <CODE>BANNER</CODE> element provides a means for a banner
of HTML that will always remain on the screen. This might be a
copyright notice, a toolbar, or any other content which should
always be available.

<P> The <CODE>BIG</CODE> and <CODE>SMALL</CODE> elements allow for
rendering text as bigger or smaller, as compared to the default
text size.

<P>The <CODE>TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>MATH</CODE> elements provide
for a more sophisticated means of layout. The <CODE>TABLE</CODE>
element allows the author to specify a spreadsheet-style arrangement,
with cells that can contain text, images, and even input elements
for <CODE>FORM</CODE>s. The <CODE>MATH</CODE> element allows for
the description and rendering of complex mathematical formulae.

<P> The <CODE>TAB</CODE> element allows the author to specify tab
stops within the document.

<P> In addition, some entities have been added, such as
"<CODE>&amp;emspace;</CODE>", to provide finer control over spacing.

<P> For more information about these additional elements and entities,
see the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html3/CoverPage.html">HTML 3.0
specification</A>.

<H4><A NAME="netscape_page_layout">Netscape</A></H4>

<P> The Netscape approach cannot be called a "style sheet,"
per se. Rather, as of the 1.1 release of Netscape Navigator, Netscape
has provided several "enhanced" elements to help control
presentation. These elements include <CODE>FONT</CODE>, <CODE>BASEFONT</CODE>,
<CODE>IMG</CODE>, and <CODE>BODY</CODE>.

<P> The <CODE>FONT</CODE> and <CODE>BASEFONT</CODE> elements allow
changing the size of font within a document. The <CODE>IMG</CODE>
element, on the other hand, has been enhanced to provide text
flow around images in documents.

<P> The <CODE>BODY</CODE> element now allows control over the background.
The author is allowed to provide a background color or image for
their document. In addition, the author can specify different
colors for hypertext links, in case the default colors do not
have sufficient contrast to the new background color.

<P> If you would like more information, Netscape Communications has
provided documentation of their HTML extensions online (both for the
<A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions.html">Netscape
HTML 2.0 extensions</A> and the <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions_3.html">Netscape
HTML 3.0 extensions</A>).

<P> <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Be careful when changing colors for hypertext
links. Most browsers take the approach of using a bright color
(such as bright blue), which has high contrast to the default
page background, for links which have not yet been followed; and
of using a dull color (such as dark blue), which has less contrast
to the default page background, for links which have already been
followed. Readers have become used to this high-contrast/low-contrast
visual cue, and changing the link colors can confuse readers.

<P> The best approach is to, first, not change the link colors unless
you have to. With most background colors, the defaults should
still be fine. If you do need to change the link colors, use a
color that is bright, and high-contrast to the background color,
for links to pages which have not yet been visited. Use a duller
version of that same color for links that have already been followed.

<H1><A NAME="web_style_considerations"></A>Web Style Considerations
</H1>

<P> A quick plug: Chapter 5 of <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE> discusses
many of the issues you should take into account in planning and
administering your Web (in fact, the entire book revolves around
the subject in great detail). Here we will also address that subject,
considering the architecture of your infostructure.

<H2><A NAME="organization">Organization</A></H2>

<P> When organizing your infostructure, there are several important
issues to consider. These issues include:

<P> <STRONG>Presenting a clear ordering of information</STRONG> by
subject (table of contents), or some other form of reasonable
entry into the infostructure. Some useful forms are:

<UL>
<LI>Table of Contents
<LI>Searchable Index
<LI>What's New (with the organic nature of online documents, a
time-oriented ordering will help the infonaut quickly orient herself
with what is new and/or changed in otherwise familiar territory)
</UL>

<P> The reader needs to be able to find what they are looking for,
and a good overview that allows the reader to quickly find a particular
topic or document is invaluable.

<P> <STRONG>Only making a document as long as it needs to be</STRONG>.
If a document can be logically decomposed into more then one file,
do so, but only decompose a document if the narrative branches
from the linear structure of the current document. An example
of this is breaking a book-length work up into chapters, and further
breaking those chapters up into sections. Because of the length
of time involved in retrieving documents, making the document
available in readable chunks means that the reader can use the
information without becoming overwhelmed in loading times and
a correspondingly large amounts of information presented a single,
huge, scrolling document.

<P> Correspondingly, make sure a document is richly cross-referenced,
so that if reader wants to ask, "Why?", she can. If
you can split up supplementary information into separate documents,
do so. This allows the reader to follow a main flow of narrative,
but still able to look up evidence and additional related stories
and information as necessary. But don't put in so many links that
the reader gets lost trying to follow them all.

<P> <STRONG>Providing a clear, consistent navigation
structure</STRONG>.  You should always be easily able to navigate to
all documents which immediately relate, but you should also always be
able to get any other document in the infostructure with a minimum of
fuss. Always provide access to the original table of contents, or its
equivalent. This is especially important for when others create links
to documents in your Web, but do not necessarily create links to your
main entry points; readers can find themselves in the middle of what
is obviously a larger document, but without any means of finding
additional information. See <CITE><A HREF="#scenic_path">Main Roads and
Scenic Paths</A></CITE>, below.

<H2><A NAME="design_goals">Design Goals</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="importance_of_content">Importance of content</A></H3>

<P> Anyone working with HTML for any length of time will soon realize
that the markup language is composed of containers, which label
content. It should be obvious, then, that your web should be primarily
about this content, whatever it may be.

<P> That's not to say that content only lies between HTML tags: content
is also found in other media types, of course, and, depending
upon the type of information you provide, sounds or images may
be more important to both you and your readers than other types
of media.

<P> Web sites, however, should be driven by content, not by vanity or
the need or desire to make a buck. Whatever your background, you have
real "content" -- information, discussion, narrative, ideas -- to
publish on the Web. People <EM>will</EM> visit your site to find this
content. Provide it. Focus your site around it.

<P> The largest threat to the Web is that as it becomes insanely popular,
instead of becoming a world-wide information repository, as its
founders and proponents have hoped, it becomes a large intertwined
mass of self-referential sites unwittingly involved in meta-discussions
on the nature of the Web: home pages which say little more than
"This is my home page" (or "our home page",
in the case of the corporate or organizational "presence"),
with a collection of links which (virtually) point to the same
collections of sites as the last page you visited did.

<H3><A NAME="scenic_path">Main Roads and Scenic Paths: Issues
of Navigability</A></H3>

<P> As readers attempt to sail the seas of your infostructure, it
is important that you provide useful ways for them to move around
in your infostructure. Many readers complain about the proliferation
of links in documents, providing so many choices that it becomes
impossible to decide where to go next. The blessings of hypertext -- leaving
control in the hands of the reader -- can also be a curse, as
the original thrust of the narrative becomes awash in side tracks
and dead ends.

<P> A means of approaching this problem is to use the metaphor of
"main roads" and "scenic paths." This means
categorizing the kinds of links you include into two major groups:
those which are recommended next destinations, and those which
lead off into explanatory side-trails and divergences. As an example,
a main path through a hypertext version of a book would be a linear
progression from first chapter to the last. A side trail, on the
other hand, would be a reference from (for example) Chapter 6's
description of CGI functionality in various HTTP servers to Chapter
8's extended discussion of CGI scripting.

<P> This is not to say that there is a single main path through a
document -- there can be several (just as there are several
ways to read a book, including as a linear narrative, and as a
random-access reference). And side trails include references outside
of the immediate document, such as bibliographic references. In
addition, side trails can become main paths if the trail leads
to another document instead of self-contained explanation.

<P> The point, however, is that a document (in the extended sense
of several HTML pages collected and interlinked) should contain
at least one or more author-defined main paths through the text,
in order to provide a guidepost for those exploring the information.
These main paths should take the form of "next" and
"previous" anchors, links back to the table of contents
and index from any point within the document, and pointers to
alternate main paths which are available (where appropriate).

<P> Although hypertext is based on notions of non-linear text, readers
<em>do</em> make it linear as they read through it. And it doesn't
hurt to provide at least one sensible linear pathway through the
document for readers who aren't interested in wandering around
in hyperspace.

<H3><A NAME="consistency">Consistency</A></H3>

<P> Consistency is what brings your site together so that it feels
like a cohesive whole -- it can unite otherwise disparate topics
or content areas, and it can be used to give your site a distinctive
feel in comparison to other sites, or a sense of personality.
Consistency also lends to the maintenance of a site -- if you
have a certain way of doing things site-wide, it becomes much
easier to make significant site-wide changes without putting a
great deal of time into it. You can achieve site-wide consistency
a number of ways:

<H4><A NAME="headers_and_footers">Headers and footers</A></H4>

<P> A standard site-wide graphical banner or text-based header can
be used to easily identify the site or sponsoring organization.
Your header doesn't necessarily need to be static across the site;
you can easily share dimensions and a primary graphic element
across banners while making each one relate specifically to the
content at hand.

<P> Footers can be used in the same way; a standard method to sign
documents and/or a standard text-based or graphical menu bar can
easily pull a site together, not only as a design element, but
also as an easy way to always navigate to the table of contents
or index of a site.

<P> Server-side includes, supported by most HTTP servers, can simplify
some of this work, allowing you to create generic headers and
footers which can be modified once and included in all of your
documents.

<H4><A NAME="graphic_elements">Graphic elements</A></H4>

<P> A unifying theme for graphic elements throughout the site easily
pulls it together into a whole. A shared motif, such as bubbles,
sign posts, or a corporate logo, works, as does a site-wide color
scheme or page backgrounds. You can rely on sizing and positioning
of graphic elements or textual elements, as well, to achieve a
unified feel.

<H4><A NAME="personality_and_style">Personality and style</A></H4>

<P> Beyond images and design elements, sites come together because
of personality and style. A consistent feel or attitude for a
site, conveyed across textual and graphic elements, can not only
make each piece feel as if it's part of a larger whole, it can
also attract readers who share the same attitude or outlook (or
are fascinated by yours). The best sites on the Web aren't necessarily
the most polished, but those that pull readers back again and
again not only because of informational content but also because
of the voice with which that content is presented.

<P> For documents which should have a personality all their own, such
as user home pages, you can still pull all these different personalities
and outlooks together by presenting a common theme or launching
point. All the users of a particular Internet service provider,
for example, have something in common by the sheer fact of their
being there -- and by the mere fact of providing a top page
view to user-maintained areas, the service provider has begun
to form a community around which a commonality can develop.

<H3><A NAME="persistent_urls">Persistent URLs</A></H3>

<P> Although <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/">Universal
Resource Names</A>, or URNs, are being developed in order to provide a
naming system similar to the domain naming system for URLs, at this
point it remains desirable to use URLs as if they refer to the same
resource persistently through time.

<P> As a content provider, you can help provide those who make link
which point to your site by developing a file structure which
will allow you to manage content as it grows and develops.

<P> If your Web space is based on a hierarchical filing system, you
can avoid major reorganization of that file system by

<UL>
<LI>thinking not only about organizing your current content, but
how you plan on developing and expanding that content in the future
<LI>creating a file space which is neither too shallow nor too
deep for your content.
</UL>

<P> An example might be an organization which has just created a new
division, Foobar. Currently, there's little information to publish
about Foobar on the Web: Foobar has a mission statement and little
else. Though it might logically follow to create a file, "foobar.html",
to hold the mission statement, and to store it in the same directory
as your main organization's web, it might be wiser to create a
subdirectory named <CODE>foobar</CODE> which could then contain
<CODE>foobar.html</CODE> and other files, as Foobar expands. This
way, links don't have to be changed or redirected down the road
when Foobar adds additional files and perhaps chooses to design
and administer its own web space. If part of Foobar's mission
statement is to spin off into its own organization, you might
even create a directory on the same level as the parent organization's,
to signify within the URL path the relative autonomy of the division
and its future direction.

<P> Another way to manage URLs is to only publicize a few well-known
entry points to your Web: for example, the top view, or table
of contents page, and perhaps an index page, or a FAQ page.

<P> When URLs do change, it's important that you not only provide
links from the old URLs to the new ones (or redirect the URLs
to the new ones), but you also make an attempt to notify those
that have links into your Web space, through general announcements
or by contacting directly those who have well-known links to your
documents (such as <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A>).

<H3><A NAME="seamlessness">Seamlessness</A></H3>

<P> Your web space should not only be consistent with itself internally,
it should make references between the site and the outside world
appear seamless.

<P> A good case in point is the corporate site which has made its
product information available via the Web, but, under the link
for Ordering Information, only provides an 800 number in order
to purchase the advertised commodity. Or the home page for a band
which doesn't provide any audio clips of the band's songs, but
just a thumbnail image of the cover art from their most recent
album, available through some obscure indie label. Or the online
newspaper which provides news coverage, but doesn't push the envelope
and provide a real way to participate in the political process.

<P> Seamlessness is about bridging the gap between the world you create
within your web and the world outside it. Often, this means not
carrying over from traditional broadcast media restrictions or
limitations that fail to make sense in interactive media. 

<H2><A NAME="macro_n_micro">Macrocosms and Microcosms</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="entire_server_structure">The big picture: entire
server structure</A></H3>

<P> A site-wide strategy to organize information is never easy to
invent, but vitally important to your site's success as a place
where information is retrieved and used, versus simply being an
area in which content is stored.

<H4><A NAME="server_structure_metaphor">Finding a metaphor</A></H4>

<P> Of course, there's no single recipe or structuring mechanism which
you can apply to all types of content to give you a well-designed
web site. That comes from thinking about the nature of your site
and your content, and the logical divisions that your content
can be organized around. However, finding an existing metaphor
which you can work within while also pushing the boundaries of
can be an effective way to plan for the organization of a site.

<P> There are many obvious metaphors upon which to base a web site:
thinking of your content as being organized like a book, building,
or branching tree.

<H4><A NAME="server_as_book">The book metaphor: pages of content</A></H4>

<P> Books lend themselves easily to the Web: and, in fact, many books
have been "ported" to the Web, for better and for worse.
Books have tables of contents and indices, for quickly locating
information; parts, chapters, sections, and sub-sections, for
organizing content; and footnotes, endnotes, and bibliographies,
for displaying links to other content. Collections of books become
"libraries", complete with card catalogs and help desks.

<P> However, books also have pages which display content statically,
while computer displays have a single, dynamic screen. A book
metaphor quickly falls apart when applied to the Web on a page
level: you could choose to consider a single HTML document a "page",
causing you to break up content into arbitrarily small and hard
to manage, difficult to navigate pieces; or you could think of
whatever text and graphics being currently displayed on a screen
as a "page", which could easily drown the user in a
sea of text without the benefit of traditional navigational tools
such as page breaks and numbering of pages. The screen is not
a page.

<H4><A NAME="server_as_artifice">The building metaphor: content
as artifice</A></H4>

<P> Sites can also be managed as being housed in a building, a collection
of buildings, or along some other spatial metaphor. The information
you hope to store and manage is divided for the user along content
areas, which is housed in different "buildings", which
can then be further subdivided into "rooms". Obviously,
this can be effective for some types of content, such as a large
corporate site with many divisions, or a museum or gallery: basically,
any information which can be mapped into a spatial plane consistently
lends itself to this sort of view.

<P> At the same time, a spatial metaphor in a largely text-driven
medium, as the Web is today, is often hard to pull off convincingly.
<A HREF="http://vrml.wired.com/">VRML (Virtual Reality Markup Language)</A>
and other such developments will allow for the creation of virtual
spaces; even then, the connecting points between rooms or buildings -- hallways
and walkways -- need to be considered thoughtfully. It's also
the case that, at many sites, the metaphor is dropped too quickly:
you're asked to select a content area based upon a clickable map-based
view, but then you're dropped into pages of descriptive text.
Not only can this be disconcerting for a user, it points out the
fact that oftentimes resources aren't allocated wisely across
a Web site, with too much attention and time spent on the top
page of a site in comparison to the remainder of the site.

<H4><A NAME="server_as_tree">The branching metaphor: regimented
growth</A></H4>

<P> A third way of thinking about a site as a whole is using a branching
metaphor, where all content springs from a common root and then
branches out into many divisions and content areas. This is an
obvious metaphor to use for web sites built atop file systems,
since most file systems share this organization of directories
(or folders) branching into subdirectories (or subfolders), and
so on.

<P> A branching metaphor shouldn't be pursued over the linear flow
of information, however: too many branches can be confusing or
frustrating for a user, especially if navigating those branches
requires repeated jumps to a monolithic top structure.

<P> In general, there some key issues you should keep in mind when
organizing a site on a macro level, including:

<P> <STRONG>Providing a main entry point</STRONG>, or top view, which
makes it easy for users to find the content which they're most
interested in. At times, you'll know exactly what a user is looking
for: if you run a site which provides audio clips of theme songs
from popular cartoon series of the '70s, users probably expect
to find a listing of available audio samples or a link to such
a listing from your site's top page. Other times, you can't be
expected to know: for a site covering a wide diversity of subjects,
it may be necessary to provide a search mechanism or user-customizable
top view in order for users to navigate your site comfortably.

<P> <STRONG>Offering multiple paths to the same content</STRONG>.
Not all readers seek the same information in the same way. A good
glossary or index will cross-reference information: for example,
you may be told to look under "automobiles" if you seek
information under "cars". That same information could
probably be found by looking through a table of contents. With
hypertext links, you can refer to the same information in many
ways. Do so, where it facilitates the user without overwhelming
her.

<P> Keep in mind, too, that a site, whether it be a file system or
a database, need not be organized as the user sees it: the underlying
structure doesn't have to be identical to the structure which
the user navigates. However, a close relationship between the
two can make it easier to maintain a site, as content is revised
and expanded. A change in one part of your web space can have
an impact on other parts of your site which share links or other
references: the easier it is for you to see these relationships
while maintaining these underlying documents, the more likely
it becomes that your site as a whole is kept up-to-date and cohesive.

<H3><A NAME="document_structure">The little picture: a document
corpus</A></H3>

<P> Many of the decisions you make on a site-wide level to organize
content carry over to the management of "documents",
whether they be single pages of HTML, or a collection of such
pages which cover a single topic. These things include such obvious
carry-overs as having an overview of the information presented
within the document available to the reader at the "top"
page, or expected entry point; making links available at appropriate
points (usually, at the tops or the bottoms of pages) to bring
the reader back to the overview for the document; and keeping
your collection of documents uniform in terms of both content
and form.

<P> Much of the management of documents, though, is the management
of links. Hypertext is all about links -- this should be patently
obvious to most. But <EM>producing</EM> hypertext is all
about managing links from the perspective of your potential reader.
Too often, Web documents fail by failing to manage links effectively -- either
by delivering screenfulls and screenfulls of ever-scrolling text,
or providing index-card-sized groupings of hypertext which link
in a myriad of directions to other index-card-sized groupings
of hypertext. Neither end of the spectrum allows the user to navigate
the content presented easily: in one case, one becomes disoriented
in a sea of text; in the other, in an ocean of links. Worse yet,
documents can become so overseasoned with random and senseless
connections to every possible place that that the reader becomes
lost in a sea of text <EM>and</EM> links!

<P> The key to managing links in your documents (besides simply verifying
that they are correct) is to organize them into classifications,
and to employ links of various classifications in a reasonable
and intelligent way. The next few sections describe some of the
various classifications of links.

<H4><A NAME="links_to_footnotes">Footnotes</A></H4>

<P> There are two traditional purposes for footnotes: for bibliographic
references, and for further commentary and/or elaboration of points
within the main text. Links to short explanatory text within a
hypertext document can be useful to readers, if it's clear from
context that the link is a digression.

<P> Within your documents, the "footnote" style of link
should be regarded as an explanatory link which elaborates on
the current discussion without drawing the reader away from the
main text. A footnote will draw the reader away temporarily, explain
something, and then allow the reader to return to the main flow
of text. While a footnote might offer further links to further
explanations of greater depth, the footnote itself is usually
nothing more than a brief explanation or glossary-style definition.

<P> You can achieve this effect by context, by linking from a phrase
(as in the lemming example below) to a short explanation or parenthetical
remark that explains the text in question. If you are to trying
to achieve a more traditional effect, you can also use numbered
note references, by either using a number surrounded by brackets
(<CODE>[1]</CODE>), or by using the <CODE>SUP</CODE> element in
HTML 3 (<CODE>&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;</CODE>).

<P> HTML 3 also defines the FN element for use in footnotes, which,
"when practical, [should be] rendered as pop-up notes":

<PRE>
&lt;P&gt;Nothing is certain about the &lt;A HREF="#FN1"&gt;lemmings&lt;/A&gt;,
other than that they left as they came, with nothing but a silly grin an
some lemon pies.

&lt;FN ID="fn1"&gt;Lemmings: Small rodents that like to leap off of
cliffs if necessary for retrieving a really nice lemon pie.&lt;/FN&gt;
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="links_to_whole_documents">Whole documents</A></H4>

<P> Where the footnote provides brief elaboration, the link to a "whole
document" (whether it be a single document, or to the entry
point for a collection of documents) provides a whole new potential
area of exploration. This is the most common sort of link, which
provides a connection between your document and the outside world.

<P> This sort of link should be used with care. It has the potential
to draw your reader completely away from your document, by providing
supplementary information that takes longer to read than the original
document. It is better to use footnote-style links for explanation
and elaboration, and from there to use links to outside documents
to provide further reference information for the curious (and
insatiable) reader. Another danger is that of peppering your document
with random hypertext links that a reader feels she must follow,
without actually providing further explanations or further reading
that's germane to the context or the point of your own document.

<P> On the other hand, if you are referring directly to another on-line
document, this is the kind of link to use. By providing direct
access to supplementary material for your readers, you can give
them as much or as little detail as they are willing to plow through.

<H4><A NAME="links_to_indices">Indices</A></H4>

<P> Another form of link is the index. Unlike the previous two classifications,
which provide further information for the reader as they advance
through the text, the index allows the reader to enter the text
from whatever point she desires, so that she can get right to
the meat of what she is interested in. An index allows the reader
to cut through the author's pre-designed tour of the information,
and get right to that vital information on wildebeest's dietary
habits.

<P> There are several variations on this. The most popular is the
full-text searchable, allowing readers to query a database of keywords
and retrieve those portions of your text which contain those
keywords. <A
HREF="http://www2.ncsu.edu/bae/people/faculty/walker/hotlist/isindex.html">Several
software packages provide full-text searching capability</A>, and <A
HREF="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/">the WN server</A> provides has
searching built-in.

<P> Another variation is often found in books: an enumerated list
of keywords. This differs from an index where the reader supplies
the keywords in that the author can provide a selection of keywords
that are particularly useful for finding information. This is
important-picking proper keywords can be an arcane art, sometimes
requiring intimate knowledge of the contents of the collection
being searched. Especially if the collection is a large one, most
keywords will return a large amount of documents which may be
only partially related to what the reader had in mind.

<P> Yet another variation provides even more refinement and selection:
the table of contents. A table of contents is a form of index,
organized by broad topic. Consider providing not just one, but
multiple tables of contents for your documents, especially if
there is more than one reasonable way in which to read the information.

<H2><A NAME="portability">Portability Between Server Platforms</A></H2>

<P> One of the advantages of HTML, which most Web documents consist
of, is that HTML is based upon a number of other clearly defined,
widely supported, non-proprietary formats, such as ISO Latin-1
and Internet Media Types (itself based on MIME). This approach
makes it much more likely that, a decade from now, your documents
will not be part of some legacy system which is, at best, difficult
to maintain and expand.

<P> If your documents do have that kind of lifespan, however, it's
probable that they will reside on multiple hosts in that timeframe:
perhaps concurrently, in the case of popular sites which are mirrored.
A little attention to the requirements of different filesystems
during the initial planning of your site could save a lot of time
spent renaming files and links in the future.

<P> About filesystems: some make the argument that Web servers should
sit atop databases, instead of filesystems; databases certainly
allow non-hierarchical relationships between pieces of content
and make it easier to provide "dynamic" documents (documents
which alter their appearance or content based upon the user accessing
the data or other conditions) than traditional filesystem-based
approaches. By the time this book sees print, there will certainly
be several HTTP-serving database systems which address many of
the issues raised here "automatically".

<P> There are some very compelling reasons for using a database over
a file system. A database-oriented system might be utilized to
maintain linkages as documents move and change; to track documents
as they grow old, alerting maintainers to update the documents
periodically so that they do not suffer "bit-rot"; and
to generate multiple representations of a collection of information
dynamically (allowing your readers to order your document collections
in ways that make sense to them). However, a database approach
is not required to get some of this functionality; other tools
also exist that also do these sorts of things (Chapter 7 of <CITE>Web
Weaving</CITE> covers these sorts of tools in more detail; examples
include <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/MOMspider/">MOMspider</A>
and the <A HREF="http://www.webtechs.com/html-val-svc/">HTML Validation
Service</A>).

<P> But this automation may not come cheap: there will always be a
learning curve to mastering any system, proprietary or non-proprietary,
and the skills learned from managing a proprietary system are
not easily transferred to other systems. You, as an information
provider, must rely on your database solutions vendor to understand
your needs and continue to build the feature-set of the system
to satisfy them as you develop and grow. You may be risking the
future of your documents -- by marrying your content to a single-vendor
methodology -- for some short-term gains in manageability and
ease of publishing content.

<P> Do keep these sorts of considerations in mind: a fear of ours
is that the Web, as it moves forward almost exponentially, may
lose any sense of history as links fail and documents drop out
of view because the cost of maintenance and "keeping up"
has grown to great. Pick simple solutions over complex ones.

<H3><A NAME="naming_space">Naming Space</A></H3>

<P> Historically, most Web servers have been Unix-based, and have
used the naming space associated with that operation system. Many
servers have since been developed for other platforms, however,
and it's no doubt prudent that, as you create documents, you do
not adhere to a naming space for a particular platform such that
you make it difficult to move your documents to another platform.

<OL>
<LI>Some filesystems have naming spaces which are case-sensitive.
Unix is a good example of an OS which would consider "document.html"
a different file from "Document.html", while other file
systems, such as the Mac OS, make no such distinction -- both
names would refer to the same file. For the sake of portability,
it's probably best to keep all the file and directory names within
your web structure lowercase. An added benefit is that this makes
your URLs much more human-communicable: it's much easier to read
an all-lowercase URL over the phone than one which contains both
uppercase and lowercase characters, when case is significant.

<LI>Some filesystems require file extensions to properly type
files. Servers running under the Mac OS could serve up files with
proper Content-type headers based upon the file's creator and
file type stored in the file's resource fork; other filesystems
use extensions to do this typing. It's always wise to use the
appropriate file extension for the content type -- such as .gif
for GIF files -- whenever possible.

<LI>Some filesystems are restricted to a limited number of significant
characters. DOS and Windows, of course, only allow eight characters,
plus three characters for the file extension. Generally, filenames
under 32 characters should be fairly cross-platform, but for DOS/Windows
(although Windows 95 and NT eliminate this restriction). If you
think your files may ever need to live on a DOS or Windows server,
you may need to restrict yourself to 8 + 3 character filenames.

<LI>Almost all filesystems define special characters.
</OL>

<P> Almost all operating systems allow certain special characters in filenames,
while disallowing others; the Mac OS, for example, allows slashes
in file names, while Unix doesn't. It's best to avoid all characters
but for the letters a through z, the numbers 0 through 9, and
the underscore, hyphen, and period.

<H2><A NAME="developing_content">Developing Content</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="uniqueness">Uniqueness</A></H3>

<P> Uniqueness may not be seen as an important design goal at first
glance: after all, uniqueness -- not duplicating efforts by
creating or compiling same or similar content -- may appear
to be more of a community issue than an organizational one.

<P> Providing a unique resource, however, increases traffic to your
site, and adds to the authoritativeness of your content (see below).
It will also require support, and a popular, unique resource can
have a spill-over effect on the other content you provide on your
site, especially if your site has a consistent feel and character.

<P> In addition, redoing what has already been done elsewhere can
add to frustration on the part of readers. Providing yet another
list of exciting online resources means that there is simply more
of the same sort of content available, which readers must then
evaluate and compare to other such resources. Providing a unique
resource (or a resource in short supply) means that you are adding
to the content of the network, instead of duplicating it.

<P> How to check for uniqueness of content? There are many search
mechanisms on the Web, such as <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A>.
You can also check in relevant newsgroups and mailing lists. (Chapter
10 of <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE> covers these sorts of issues in
more detail).

<P> You can also produce your content so that it leans towards providing
unique, value-added content: instead of simply providing a list
of poetry sites, say, you could provide a list of poetry resources
which you find particularly compelling, with descriptions of why
you think they are compelling. Adding value and content means
that you are being a good network citizen, leaving the community
with more than you found it with.

<H3><A NAME="authoritativeness">Authoritativeness</A></H3>

<P> Authoritativeness has always been a fallacy, except when read
as author-itativeness; whatever claims to authority you or your
organization have ultimately boil down to status and reputation
within the community. One becomes a reputable source not by being
non-refutable, but by putting a stamp on what you write; by claiming
authorship, and, thereby, author-ity.

<P> This means that readers must take greater responsibility for critically
analyzing what documents they come across. But it also means that
you must be responsible in establishing credentials for what you
claim, providing source material and raw data to justify your
conclusions.

<P> In some sense, this is the end result of all of the things we
discuss here (and in <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE>). In building and
maintaining your infostructure what you are aiming for is authoritativeness;
for creating documents which are well thought out and well designed;
which do not become stale or inaccurate; and which remain both
internally and externally consistent. Your mission now is to use
the tools we have provided you with to place the stamp of authority
and relevance on your own works, and to truly create infostructures
on the Web which are compelling and creative. Good luck!

<H1><A NAME="for_more_info">For More Information</A></H1>

<P> There already exist documents on the Web which address this same
topic, and perhaps in more detail. For definitive reference information
you may wish to check the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/">HTML specifications</A>

For a more detailed discussion of HTML composition style, you
should also check the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Overview.html">Style Guide</A>
(especially the section on <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/DeviceIndependent.html">device-independent formatting</A>),
which is also from the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</A>. 

<P> If you're looking for a good document for learning the basics
of HTML, you will want to check out the <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html">Beginner's Guide to HTML</A>,
from NCSA.

<P> Also useful is the Bibliography from <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE>,
from <A HREF="http://www.aw.com/">Addison-Wesley</A> (as soon
as this is placed on-line, I'll put a link to it here).

<P> Finally, the somewhat creatively-minded among you can draw inspiration
from this page's evil twin,
<A HREF="http://www.zikzak.net/~acb/hacks/htmlth.html">Composing Evil HTML</A>.
Officially, I don't endorse any of these techniques. Unofficially . . .
well, let's just say someday I intend to buy Andrew several beers.

<P> I'd like to thank all of you who have visited this document and
commented on it, suggesting fixes, clarification, and even new
sections. You know who you are (even if I managed to lose your
addresses in the flood of information)! It is, in some senses,
always a work in progress and is always amenable to suggestion,
modification, and repair. I appreciate your help!

<P>We (the authors of <CITE>Web Weaving</CITE>) especially like to
thank the folks at <A HREF="http://www.aw.com/devpress/">Addison-Wesley</A>,
for helping us turn all of this into much more than I, at least,
ever thought it would be. There's something just so satisfying
about actually holding a book, hypertext be damned.
