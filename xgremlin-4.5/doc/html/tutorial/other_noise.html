<H2>  Finding noise in interferogram</H2>
<P>
The problem with finding noise in an interferogram is finding a
portion of the interferogram that is really noise and no signal. Even
at the ends of an interferogram, there is some modulation left which
will give a false estimate of the noise level. The solution is to read
in a section at the end of the interferogram where the noise dominates
and to take the <A HREF="../commands/fourtran.html">Fourier transform</a>. 
You will then get a rather noisy spectrum. Plot this spectrum, and
manually take out all the lines using the 
<A HREF="../commands/connect.html"><b>connect</b> </a> command,
&lt;Alt+c&gt;, as described in section
<A HREF="analyse_initial.html"> 'Subtract continuum'  </A>. Then
transform the result back  again and you will be left with only the
noise in the interferogram.
