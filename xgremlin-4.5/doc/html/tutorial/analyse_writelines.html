The meaning of the columns are as follows:

<dL ><DT><b>2: wavenumber</b>
<DD> The wavenumber (or wavelength if that is your primary unit)
<DT><b>3: peak ht</b>
<DD> The intensity (peak). This is the signal-to-noise if you have
scaled the spectrum so that the noise is 1. 
<DT><b>4: width</b>
<DD> The full width at half maximum, in mK (or m&#197; if you are
using &#197;ngstr&#246;ms).
<DT><b>5: damping</b>
<DD> The damping paramter. This is the ratio of the Lorentzian
width to the total width of the line, and thus runs from 0 (for a pure
Gaussian) to 1 (for a pure Lorentzian).
<DT><b>6: E.W.</b>
<DD> The integrated intensity of the line (equivalent width in mK).
<DT><b>7: itn</b>
<DD> The number of times the line has been fitted with lsqfit
<DT><b>8: H</b>
<DD>  A code indicating whether any parameters have been fixed
during the fit.
<DT><b>9: tags</b>
<DD> A code indicating the origin and history of the line. `F'
means the line has been found with <b>linelist</b> or
<b>findlines</b>; `I' means it has been added from the plot; `L'
means it has been fitted with lsqfit; and `G' means it is a centre of
gravity.
<DT><b>10-13: epstot  epsevn  epsodd epsran</b>
<DD> The residuals left from the fit.

<DT><b> 14: identification</b>
<DD> Any identification you may have added to the line
<DT><b>15: (unlabelled)</b>
<DD> The wavelength in &#197; (or wavenumber in cm^-1 if your
primary units are wavelengths)
