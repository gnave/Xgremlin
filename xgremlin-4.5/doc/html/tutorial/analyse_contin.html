Here is the result of the command 
<A HREF="../commands/extended.html"><B>extended bin</B></A> on an
infra-red file. There is an obvious continuum which needs to be
subtracted off. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="contin_mark.gif"><br>
To do this, go through the file placing markers as shown. The aim is
to roughly draw a line through the continuum. When you have finished,
<A HREF="../commands/multiply.html">multiply</A> the result by -1.,
and <A HREF="../commands/save.html">save</A><EM>n</EM> the result to
the scratch directory. This is what it will look like:

To correct the original file, first 
<A HREF="../commands/create.html">create</A> the file and then run 
<A HREF="../commands/extended.html"><b>extended add</b></A><EM>n</EM>,
<EM>n</EM> being the number of the entry in the scratch
directory. Then
<A HREF="../commands/close.html"><B>close</B></A> both <B>datain</B>
and <B>dataout</B> and re-open the newly-created file as datain. This
is what an <B>extended bin</B> on the file looks like:<br>

The continuum is now down to the level of the noise.
