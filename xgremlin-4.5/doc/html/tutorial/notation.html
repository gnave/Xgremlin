<h2>Notation</h2>
In this document, the following notation is used. Command that are typed
in at the keyboard are designated by <b> bold mode</b>. Names of
files, variables, arguments, etc. are <em> emphasized</em>. 
<a href="../tutorial/Notation.html"> Highlighted 
commands</a> are links to other parts of the help system. The case of
commands is important, particularly in the plotting routines, where
different cases of the same letter do different jobs. Also the type of
the argument is important. If you miss the decimal point off a
floating point argument, Xgremlin will do something completely different to
what you intended. In describing the commands, the standard FORTRAN 
conventions for names have been used (i.e. i-n are integer, the
rest are real). Some commands within Xgremlin can operate with complex
data, and others cannot, so it is important to know whether you have
real or complex data.
