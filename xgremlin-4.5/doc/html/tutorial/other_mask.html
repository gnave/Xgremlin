<P>
Sometimes you may want to do a Fourier transform of data in the
<em>r</em> array even if the number of data points is not a power of
two. The solution is to padd the interferogram up to a power of two
with zeros, but this has the disadvantage of leaving a large jump in the
interferogram, which gives bad ringing in the resulting spectrum. The
solution is to multiply the ends of the data with a cosine bell before
padding with zeros, thus bringing the data smoothly down to zero. This
is done with the command 
<A HREF="../commands/mask.html">
<b>mask</b></A> <em>nrise</em> <em>mean</em>
where <em>nrise</em> is the width in points of the cosine bell. A
suitable value is 5-10 %. If you specify the <em>mean</em> as 0., the
mask command will set the mean of the interferogram equal to zero
before masking it (otherwise you might still get an ugly jump if your
data is not centred around zero).
<P>
You can then pad  the interferogram with zero to a power of two
with the <a href="../commands/zeropad.html"><b>zeropad</b></a> command before
transforming it with
<A HREF="../commands/fourtran.html">
<b>fourtran</b></A>.
