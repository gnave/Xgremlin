<h1>First Introduction to Xgremlin</h1>

<h2>Example Session of Xgremlin 's Capabilities</h2>

The file <em>demo.cds</em> on your disk contains an example of how to
analyse a spectrum using Xgremlin. To use it, first check the files <em>
demo.cds, demo.dat,</em> and <em>demo.hdr</em> are in your directory. Then 
run Xgremlin by typing <b>xgremlin &</b> (usually Xgremlin is run as a 
background process).
At the Xgremlin prompt, type
<b><a href="../commands/run.html">run</a> demo.cds</b>
The example reads the test data into an internal buffer, finds all
the lines above a cutoff, and plots the results. 
To continue the demonstration, type <b> run</b>.
Xgremlin then refines the fit of the lines found and plots the
residuals. By typing 
<b> run </b> 
again, the fit will be displayed, and
the line parameters listed. 
An extensive set of <a href="../plotmode.html">plot mode commands</a>
can be used to plot the data.

<h2>General Construction</h2>

To use Xgremlin, simply type <b> xgremlin</b>. The program opens the main
<a href="../tutorial/gremlin_figure.html">gremlin window</a> 
and opens several files:
<ul>
<li>  The help files listed above
<li>  A log file of the form <em> xgremlin.&lt;date&gt;.log</em>. This
      resides in your home directory
<li>  A scratch directory <em> xgremlin-scratch</em> for storage of
      temporary data.
<li>  The initialization file, called 
      <em><a href="../tutorial/startup_xgr.html">.xgremlinrc</a></em>. 
      This is a file where you can put
      aliases and commands that you frequently use when starting 
               Xgremlin.
</ul>
The log file can be re-opened under another name. This can be
useful for keeping a record of a session for later referance.
<p>
Xgremlin then runs the commands in the initialization file, and returns
control to the keyboard leaving  the Xgremlin prompt. Commands can then be
typed in after this prompt. To get a list of the commands, 
click on the <b> help</b> button and select the list of 
commands sorted either 
<a href="../commands/alphalist.html">alphabetically</a> or by 
<a href="../commands/categorylist.html"> category</a>.
<p>
In order to perform data analysis, a file must be opened and the data
read in. In addition to the data file, Xgremlin requires a header file. There
are now several formats for header files in existence of various origin
and antiquity. The latest header version is
'type 6' and this header file is a Fortran `namelist' command. This
gives it additional flexibility over previous headers as extra
information can easily be added  or deleted.
The latest version of Xgremlin should be able to cope with all header files
but problems may occur with old headers. The only solution is to check
the header file with an editor and try to make it to conform to one
that works. The most important things to look for in broken header
files are that the first and last wavenumbers are correct, the
dispersion is correct, and the number of points declared in the header
corresponds to that in the file. Also check that things that are
supposed to be integers are integers and similarly with floats, and
that there are no number fields filled with asterisks, indicating a
FORTRAN number overflow. It is
possible to add any information you want to the end of a header file,
and it can be particularly useful to append, for example, the log file
of the run that performed the transform or details of how the source 
was behaving during acquisition of the interferogram. 
<p>
Interferogram files have the extension <em> .int</em>, and spectra
<em> .dat</em>. Other filenames are used for card
input (e.g. the initialization file) or the input of ASCII data
(via the <b><a href="../commands/readdata.html">readdata</a></b>
command).
<p>
To open a spectrum file, type
<b><a href="../commands/open.html">open </a> datain</b><em> filename</em>
(with no extension to the filename). To open an interferogram file, type
<b><a href="../commands/open.html">
     open </a> datain</b><em> filename</em> <b>int</b>
The name <em> datain</em> is the
name Xgremlin then associates with the file from then on, and is called
the unit name of the file. Other examples of unit names are <em>
rawin, dataout, outfile, scratch</em>.
Gremlin then tells you if it has been successful in opening the file and
if so,  the number of points in the file and the wavenumber range. 
If it fails, check that you have typed the command correctly and that  
the files exist in the current directory. There are, as mentioned, 
occasional problems with old headers.
<p>
Data can then be read in. Xgremlin uses three main arrays for data: 
an <em> r</em> array, a <em> tr</em> array, and an <em> ffta</em> array. The
<em> ffta</em> array is used to hold interferogram data for
transforming. Spectrum data from the <em> datain</em> unit 
is read into the <em> r</em> array by default, and the
<em> tr</em> array is used for scratch space and the storage of temporary
data.  It can usually be ignored. Data can be swapped between them with
<a href="../commands/exchange.html">exchange</a> and 
<a href="../commands/move.html">move</a> and 
In addition, there is the <em> phase</em> array, which is used during
the main Fourier transform for phase correction.
<p>

To read in data, type
<b><a href="../commands/read.html">read</a></b><em> f1 n2</em>
where <em> f1</em> is the initial wavenumber and <em> n2</em> is the number of
points to read in. Both these parameters are optional, in which case
it will read in as many points as possible, starting at the first
wavenumber in the file. If you have opened an interferogram, <em>f1</em>  
should be
the initial point number of the region you wish to read in. <em> n2</em>
has a maximum value ranging from 262144 to 2 million depending on the
size of the r array -- this can be changed with the 
<a href="../commands/alloc.html"><b>alloc</b></a> command.
The default is the maximum value
or the number of points between <em> f1</em> and the end of the file,
whichever is the smaller. If you wish to read a section centred on a
particular wavenumber, type
<b><a href="../commands/set.html">set</a> centerread</b>
first. There is also the command 
<b><a href="../commands/set.html">set </a>firstread</b>
which specifies that subsequent reads should start at the wavenumber
<em> f1</em>. The data can then be plotted by typing
<b><a href="../commands/plot.html"> plot</a></b>
<p>

Other commands in Xgremlin can be split into two types: global commands that
work on the whole file or extended sections of it and buffer commands
which work on the contents of the <em> r</em> array - the current
buffer. The most important of these are the commands associated with
line finding and line fitting. The two commands for finding lines in a
spectrum are
<b><a href="../commands/linelist.html">linelist</a></b> and 
<b><a href="../commands/findlines.html">findlines</a></b>. 
<b><a href="../commands/findlines.html">Findlines</a></b>
works in a buffer and the list of lines found is destroyed by a new read
unless it has been saved in some way. 
<b><a href="../commands/linelist.html">linelist</a></b>  
finds lines in
the whole file and saves the list in a file named <em>
&lt;file&gt;.lin</em>, where <em> &lt;file&gt;</em> is the name of the file you
opened. It is a permanant file and will not be deleted when you leave Xgremlin.
A backup of the <em> .lin</em> file is made when you make the first change 
to it in each run of Xgremlin. If you wish to create another 
<em>&lt;file&gt;.lin</em> file, you can close it by typing
<b><a href="../commands/close.html">close</a></b> <b>lineio</b>,
re-name the <em>.lin</em> file outside Xgremlin, and run
<b><a href="../commands/linelist.html">linelist</a></b> 
again. The previous <em>.lin</em> file can be re-opened 
by closing the newly-created <em>.lin</em> file and then opening the old 
file using <b><a href="../commands/open.html">
     open</a></b> <b>lineio</b> <em>filename</em>.
<p>
In addition to these commands there are a few others which are
regularly used, but which do not easily fit into other sections of the
tutorial. The command 
<b><a href="../commands/alias.html">alias</a></b>
is similar to alias commands in UNIX, and is used to abbreviate a set
of commands with a single, easy to type word. The 
<b><a href="../commands/info.html">info</a></b>
command tells you the values of various variables in Xgremlin and lets
you set them. The
<b><a href="../commands/set.html">set</a></b>
command is similar, but also lets you set values of various
<b><a href="../glossary.html">registers</a></b> 
which can be useful in running batch scripts. A
third way of finding the values of variables is the
<b><a href="../commands/whats.html">whats</a></b>
command, which also lets you find out the contents of the various
arrays in Xgremlin. Finally, the
<b><a href="../commands/save.html">save</a></b>
and <b><a href="../commands/recall.html">recall</a></b> 
commands let you put data into the 
<b><a href="../glossary.html">scratch directory</a></b> 
and retrieve them.
