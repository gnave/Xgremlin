<P>
<A HREF="../commands/linelist.html">
<b>linelist</b></A> just produces a first approximation for the line
positions, intensities and widths; to get accurate values you
should perform a further least squares fit of the lines.
There is now a global method of fitting lines once you are happy you
have all the correct ones in the list. First you must set the
number of iterations using
<A HREF="../commands/set.html">
<b>set lsq</b></A> <em>itnum</em>
and the number of points read in using
<A HREF="../commands/set.html">
<b>set readlength</b></a> <em>n</em>
Then type
<A HREF="../commands/fitlines.html">
<b>fitlines</b></a> <em>wstart wstop</em>
How long it takes depends on the speed of your computer and the number
of lines and iterations you have chosen. 

<P>
Xgremlin usually does a fairly good job of fitting lines, but it is always
a good idea to check what it has done afterwards. To do this, read in
a section of the spectrum with 
<A HREF="../commands/read.html"><b>read</b></A> <em>wstart</em>,
and get the lines from the <em>.lin</em> file using
<A HREF="../commands/getlines.html"> <b>getlines</b></A>. 
You then need to subtract the fit from the data by typing 
<A HREF="../commands/active.html"> <b>active</b></A>. 
This may take some time if many lines are in the buffer. Then plot the
result and see what the residuals look like. If Xgremlin has done a
good job, the residuals will look like noise.

<P>
Large residuals may have several causes. The most likely reason is
that the actual lineshape is not a Voigt profile, which is the only
profile that Xgremlin fits. This is often the case for the strongest
lines, which may be self-absorbed in typical laboratory sources. The
residuals are <A HREF="analyse_absorb.html"> large and symmetric</a>.
In extreme cases, the line may actually self-reverse, giving a
double-humped structure. It is important to recognize these as a
single self-reversed line, and not treat them as two separate lines.

<P>
Another possibility is that the line is weak and/or blended. <A
HREF="../commands/lsqfit.html"><B>lsqfit</B></A> fits lines out to 5
half-widths, and any lines that fall within that region may affect the
fit of the line.  To fit weak and blended lines accurately it is
usually necessary to specify that the width and damping parameter
should not be revised by the fitting procedure. To do this type
<A HREF="../commands/holdwidth.html">
<b>holdwidth</b></A> <em>width linenumber</em> and
<A HREF="../commands/holddamping.html">
<b>holddamping</b></A> <em>damping linenumber</em>
where <em>width</em> and <em>damping</em> are the widths and damping
parameters you think the lines should have (check a few adjacent lines
belonging to the same multiplet to find this), and
<em>linenumber</em> is a list of lines to be fitted. Make sure the
lines are active, and then try fitting the lines again by typing
<A HREF="../commands/lsqfit.html"><b>lsqfit </b></A> <em>itnum </em>.
To return the lines to the <em>.lin</em>file, type
<A HREF="../commands/putlines.html">
<b>putlines</b></A>
<P>
A third possibility for large residuals is that the lines are
under-resolved, and are `ringing'. This is described in the section on
<A HREF="analyse_ring.html">dealing with ringing</A>.
