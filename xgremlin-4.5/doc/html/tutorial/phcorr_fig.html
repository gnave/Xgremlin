<h2> Explanation of the fields </h2>

The phase correction window is really a 'front end' for various
commands in Xgremlin to make it easy to phase correct and transform
files. For more information on any of those commands, select the links
in brackets after the title. 

The phase correction window has two sections: the 'black part', which
tells Xgremlin what parameters to use for the phase correction, and
the 'blue part', which specifies parameters used for the transform and
to save the data. Once you have filled in the field, click on the
'Phase curve' button to calculate and display the phase polynomial

<a name="fill_in"><h2> The phase correction fields</h2> </a>

<dl>
<dt><b>Interferogram file: </b>
(<a href="../commands/open.html">(open rawin)</a>
<dd> The name of the file you wish to open, without any
extension. Automatically filled in by the 'Fill in' button

<dt><b>Symmetry: </b>
<a href="../commands/onesided.html">(onesided</a>
<a href="../commands/twosided.html"> twosided)</a>
<dd> Toggles the symmetry as twosided or unbalanced, depending on how
the interferogram was sampled. If the interferogram has
<em>significantly</em> more points on one side of the centre burst
than the other (4 - 5 times as many), then the symmetry should be set
to unbalanced. In this case, the phase is calculated from the symmetric
portion of the interferogram alone, but the full interferogram is used
for the main transform, after multiplying it with an 
<a href="../glossary.html">amertizing</a> fuction to correct
for the asymmetry.

<dt><b>Interferogram center:</b>
<a href="../commands/ncenter.html">(ncenter)</a>
<dd> Sets the value of the central point, about which the transform is
performed. This is filled in automatically by the <b>fill in</b>
button if you have marked the position of the central point with a
marker in the plot window. If you have only read in a section of the
interferogram it may be incorrect, so you should check it. 
If the resulting phase plot has a large slope, or if it has a 2*pi
phase flip, you should try a different central point. The value can be
easily changed up or down with the arrow keys.

<dt><b> Invert interferogram: </b>
<a href="../commands/input.html">(input inverted)</a>
<dd> If this is set to 'yes', then the interferogram will be
multiplied by -1, causing a shift of pi in the phase. This can be
useful to avoid problems with a 
<a href="../tutorial/raw_phase.html">2*pi flip</a> in the phase

<dt><b>Spectrum type: </b>
<a href="../commands/phcorr.html">(phcorr smooth)</a>
<dd> Can be set to 'line spectrum' or 'continuum spectrum' and affects
the type of phase correction that is performed. If set to 'line
spectrum', then Xgremlin will calculate the phase points and fit a
polynomial through them. However if it is set to 'continuum spectrum',
a much simpler phase correction procedure is used -- Xgremlin finds
the phase based on a small number of points and automatically fits a
smooth curve through them; this is then used to correct the whole
spectrum. 

<dt><b>Phase curve: </b>
<a href="../commands/phcorr.html">(phcorr smooth or phcorr spline)</a>
<dd> Use a polynomial to fit or a spline to fit. Polynomial fitting usually 
gives good results and is the easiest to use. Spline fitting is sometimes 
necessary with interferograms from the NIST 2-m FTS, where kinks are often present in the phase curve around 9000 cm-1.


<dt><b>Number of terms: / Number of points</b>
<a href="../commands/phcorr.html">(phcorr)</a>. 
<dd> If the spectrum type is a line spectrum, then this specifies the
number of terms in the polynomial used to fit the phase. Initially
this should be set to zero, in which case Xgremlin does not fit any
polynomial, but simply calculates the phase points and displays
them (alternatively select the 'no fit' button). You can then check 
for <a href="../tutorial/raw_phase.html"> ghosts and phase flips</a> 
and correct the points as necessary. When you are satisfied that
Xgremlin will use the correct data to calculate the polynomial, you
can set the number of terms to some reasonable number (2-3 if the
phase is reasonably flat, but you may need as many as 8 terms from
interferograms where the phase is affected by e.g. analogue filters or
optical properties of the interferometer. 

<p>
If the spectrum type is a continuum spectrum, then this specifies the
number of points used to calculate the phase. This should be a factor
of 2, and is typically 512 or 1024 points.

<dt><b>Discriminator</b>
<a href="../commands/phcorr.html">(phcorr)</a>. 
<dd>(only for line spectra) This  the discriminator above which lines
are selected for the phase fitting, expressed as a fraction of the
maximum in the spectrum (initially 0.05). 

<p> <a name="discrim">When the phase is calculated</a>, the 
<a href="phcorr_stat.html"> statistics</a> for the points used
are displayed in the edit window.  The alias is divided into 8
sections, each of which is intially allotted 64 (=512/8) points.  If
any section is unfilled (because there are not enough points above the
discriminator in that region) the extra points are allocated in order
of amplitude to the other sections.  If the total number of points
used is significantly below 512 you should probably lower the
discriminator and start again.

<dt><b>Signal / noise:</b>
<a href="../commands/phcorr.html">(phcorr)</a>. 
<dd>     `fracnoise' is the noise relative to a spectral maximum of 1.0 
(initially 0.001). It is used to calculate (chi)&#178; for the fit.

The information on the screen before you plot the phase tells you
the polynomial coefficients and the chi-square for the fit.
If the latter is significantly greater than one, you may want to
try more terms in the polynomial (by simply repeating the above with
a new value for the number of terms) or go back to look for more
bad points.  BUT a high value for chi-square can have a different cause: 
the discriminator has probably picked several points from each very strong
line, and if the central section of the interferogram is not fully 
symmetric (due to, e.g., source intensity variation during the scan)
the imaginary part of the line profile may have a dispersive
shape so that the phase actually varies across the line (detectable by
expanding a cluster of points of large scatter).  If this is the case, an
unflattering value for chi-square should not lead to significant errors
if the interferogram is two-sided (See a paper on phase correction by 
<a href="../tutorial/references.html#phcorr">Learner et al.</a>).

<h2>The transform fields</h2>

These assume that you have just calculated phase information to be
applied during the transform. When the fields are complete, click on
the 'Fourier transform' button to perform the transform and save the file.

<dl>
<dt><b>Skip</b>
<a href="../commands/skip.html">(skip)</a>. 
<dd> Specifies the number of points, if any, to be skipped at the
start of an interferogram. You may wish to do this if, for example,
you have a glitch right at the start that you wish to get rid of, or
if you have header information at the start that you have to skip
over. Can be left blank.

<dt><b>Points</b>
<a href="../commands/input.html">(input)</a>. 
<dd> Specifies the number of points to be used in the transform. The
default value is the total number of points in the interferogram. Can
be left blank.

<dt><b>Apodize</b>
<a href="../commands/apodize.html">(apodize)</a>. 
<dd> Specifies the width in points of the cosine bell applied to the
ends of the interferogram to avoid <a href="../glossary.html">ringing</a>
in the spectrum caused by the jump to zero at the end of the
interferogram. This can be left blank, and the default is 5&#37; of
the longest side of the interferogram.

<dt><b>Range</b>
<a href="../commands/wavelimits.html">(wavelimits)</a>. 
<dd> Specifies the wavenumber range for the output file. The default
values are the first and last wavenumbers determined by the alias and
free spectral range. Can be left blank.

<dt><b>Output</b> 
<a href="../commands/complex.html">(complex</a>. 
<a href="../commands/real.html"> real)</a>. 
<dd> Both real and complex spectra can be produced. However it is
recommended that you first produce a complex spectrum to check that
the imaginary part is small everywhere. You can also either output a
real spectrum directly, or produce a real spectrum from the complex
one using <a href="../commands/copy.html"><b>copy real</b></a>. This field
must be present, and a file name is automatically suggested by
Xgremlin when you click on the 'fill in' button.
