<h1> Using Xgremlin to transform and phase correct interferograms</h1>

<h2>Why?</h2>

After recording an interferogram on your interferometer, the first
thing you will want to do is perform a Fourier transform to get the
spectrum. Assuming that you have recorded an interferogram on both
sides of the zero path difference, the transform will be a complex FT,
with a non-zero imaginary part. This imaginary part comes from several
causes:
<ul>
<li> You do not have a point exactly at the centre of the
interferogram.
<li> You have not sampled the interferogram symmetrically --
e.g. Kitt Peak interferograms often have up to five times as many
points on one side of the zero path difference as the other. This
gives an antisymmetric imaginary part after phase correction, and it
is particularly important that the phase correction is as good as
possible to avoid distorting the line profiles. 
<li> The interferogram will probably still be slightly asymmetric due
to small imperfections in the alignment or the optics, meaning that
the signal you recorded at a path difference of <em>-x</em> is not the
same as that recorded at <em>+x</em>. 
</ul>

<p>
The principle of phase correction is to make the imaginary part as
close to zero as possible. Although this is sometimes done without
intervention by the user, this is not always unsuccessful.
The solution is to do the phase correction interactively.
(See the recent paper by <a href="../tutorial/references.html#phcorr"> 
Learner et al.</a> for more details on the principles of phase correction.)

<h2>Principles</h2>

Phase correction is controlled through the 
<a href="../tutorial/phcorr_fig.html">phase correction window</a>
which is opened by selecting the <b>Phase/transform</b> menu item in the 
<a href="../tutorial/gremlins.html">gremlins</a>
<a name="gremlins">menu</a>.
There are five main steps to interactive phase correction:

<ol>
<li> 
<a name="prac_centre">Find the position</a> of the 
<a href="centre_fringe.html">central fringe.</a>
First, open the interferogram file using 
<a href="open.html"><b>open datain</b></a> <em>filename</em> <b>int</b>,
<a href="read.html"><b>read</b></a> in a section of data around the
central point, and <b>plot</b> it.
Note the point number of the expanded 
central fringe.

<p> <li> <a name="raw_phase">Transform</a> the central section of the
interferogram to give a <a href="../tutorial/raw_phase.html"> raw
phase plot</a>, using points of amplitude above some plausible
fraction of the maximum in the spectrum. Do this in the following way:

<ul>
<li>First, fill in the relevant
data in the phase window. This can be done automatically by clicking
on the <a href="phcorr_fig.html#fill_in"><b>fill in</b></a>
button, but you may need to add the centre value
by hand, and check that you have selected the correct symmetry of the
interferogram, and that you have selected either a line or continuum
spectrum. 

<li>To transform the central section, click on the <b>phase
curve</b> button. 
</ul>
The length of interferogram transformed is 256K
points, or the whole interferogram if this is shorter. (For
unequal-sided interferograms the length is the largest power of 2 that
fits in the symmetric portion.) 
The interferogram is carefully
apodized before transforming to kill the ringing from strong lines.
Up to 512 spectral points, distributed as uniformly as possible across
the alias, are used for the raw phase plot, and the discriminator may
need to be reset to get a reasonable number.

<p>
<li> Two operations may be necessary at this stage: 
<a href="../tutorial/raw_phase.html">correct for any 2 pi phase flips;</a>
and remove obvious bad points arising from alias
foldover, ghosts, etc.  Replot the raw phase to see that it is
satisfactory before proceeding.  As an optional refinement, before
plotting the phase, determine the noise level (relative to the maximum
signal) from the amplitude spectrum using the 
<a href="../commands/area.html">area</a> command on a section with no
lines. This returns, amoung other parameters, the mean of the marked
section, which is a rough measure of the noise. Setting the noise
level will enable the programme to calculate chi-square for the
phase-fit applied in step 4.

<p>
<li> Decide on the number of terms required for the phase-fit
polynomial, perform the phase correction on the same central section
and <a href="../tutorial/phase_fit.html">
inspect the result</a>.  The continuous line gives the phase curve
that has been used, and the dots now give the difference between
observed and calculated phase for the points used.  Repeat with more
terms in the polynomial if this seems desirable (maximum is 8).

<p>
<li> Transform the full spectrum; this will be phase-corrected with 
the above polynomial.  You have the option to set wavenumber 
limits for the part of the spectrum to be written to disc and to
specify real or complex or both.

execute the phase correction using a
