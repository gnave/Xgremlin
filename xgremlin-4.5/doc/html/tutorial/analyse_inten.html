<P>
Applying an intensity calibration to the output file is easily done by
typing:
<A HREF="../commands/writelines.html"><b>writelines intcorr</b></A> 
You should first have the response function of your spectrometer in
the <em>r </em> array. This corrects the <b>equivalent width</b> but leaves the
peak intensity <b>unchanged</b>, giving you a record of the signal-to-noise.
<P>

It is generating the response function that is the tricky
problem. The usual procedure is to take a separate calibration
spectrum using some standard lamp (tungsten and deuterium lamps are
commonly used). This will be a relatively low-resolution spectrum
which can be combined with the known spectral output of your
calibrated lamp to determine the response function of the
spectrometer, which should vary fairly slowly with wavenumber. 
The response function R of the spectrometer is defined by the relation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>(Standard lamp radiance) * R = (Measured radiance)</EM> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that the response function is a <b>dimensionless</b> function.
It is important to bear this in mind because whereas the radiance of 
a standard lamp is measured in <EM>W cm&#175;&#179;sr&#175;&#185;</EM>,
the signal from e.g. a photomultiplier is not proportional to the
radiative power but to the number of photons received. The calibration
spectrum must therefore be weighted with the wavenumber before
dividing it by the tabulated standard lamp radiance to obtain R. All this is done
automatically with the <a href = "../commands/response.html"> <b>response</b>
</a> command which turns the calibration spectrum in the <b>r</b>
array into the spectrometer response function with the help of a
supplied standard lamp calibration.
<P>
See the <a href = "../commands/response.html"> <b>response</b> </a>
command for a description of the format of the standard lamp
calibration file.
