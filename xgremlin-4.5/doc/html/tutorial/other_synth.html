Xgremlin has various commands for creating synthetic spectra. This can be
useful if you wish to match a known spectrum with one you have
recorded, and has been used successfully by Jon Murray to match the
hyperfine structure of the Hg 253.6 nm line to his observations and
provide a wavenumber calibration of his spectra.
<P>
The basic command is the <b>voigt</b> command, which has the form:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="../commands/voigt.html"><b>voigt</b></A> <em>wl wg nop</em>
<li><A HREF="../commands/voigt.html"><b>voigt</b></A> <em>w nop ncenter</em>
<li><A HREF="../commands/voigt.html"><b>voigt</b></A> <em>w nop</em>
</ul>
The first creates a Voigt profile of Gaussian width <em>wg</em> and Lorentzian
width <em>wl</em>, setting the number of points to <em>nop</em>. The second
form creates a Lorentzian in <em>nop</em> points, centred around
<em>ncenter</em>. The third form does the same as the second, but
centres the Lorentzian at <em>nop</em>/2.
<P>
You can investigate the effect of noise on your spectra with the command <br>
<A HREF="../commands/noise.html"> <b>noise</b></a> <em>nop</em>. This
creates a noise record in <em>nop</em> points, which can be added to a
synthetic spectra placed in <em>tr</em> using 
<A HREF="../commands/combine.html"><b>combine</b></a>. There are
various other options in the <b>noise</b> command, mainly concerned
with the method of generating the noise record - see the help file for
further details.
