<h1> Finding the central fringe </h1>

This shows a typical centre burst from an interferogram with a fairly
rich line spectrum.<p>

Sometimes it is not so easy to decide exactly
which point to take as the centre
In this case, the best thing to do is to determine the phase and
iterate through various values for the centre point to see which gives
the flattest phase.

In the case of a spectrum with few lines, it might be nearly
impossible to determine exactly which fringe is the central fringe.
If you can determine it fairly closely, you may be able to determine
it from the phase plot as before. However if this is not possible, the
only thing to do is to correct the phase of each line individually
