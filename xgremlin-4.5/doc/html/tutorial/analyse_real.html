<h2> Check phase and create a real spectrum </h2>

The first thing to do with the spectrum, if it has not been done
already, is to check the phase and and subtract any continuum. To check the
phase, first open the complex spectrum and read in a section with
<a href="../commands/read.html"><b> read</b></a> <em>waveno</em>
and plot it. If you set a large value for the r array with the 
<a href="../commands/alloc.html"><b>alloc</b></a> command
you will probably be able to read in the whole file at once. 
If you are satisfied, close the complex file using
<a href="../commands/close.html"><b>close datain</b></a> 
and open the real file.

<p>
If you have not previously prepared a real file, you should do so
now. First use the 
<a href="../commands/create.html"><b> create</b></a> <em>filename</em>
command, giving a suitable filename for output, and then save the real
part of the complex file to it with
<a href="../commands/copy.html"><b>copy real</b></a>. Then
<a href="../commands/close.html"><b>close datain</b></a> and
<b>dataout</b> and re-open the real file.
