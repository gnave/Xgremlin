<h3>The Arrays</h3>
Xgremlin is is essence a program written for the processing of 
large arrays of data which represent optical spectra. The program
is tailored for the needs of Fourier transform spectrocopy but
may also be used with e.g. digitized photographic plates from 
grating spectrographs etc. Analyzing a spectrum with Xgremlin
invariably entails the following steps:

<ol>
<li> read in data from a file into a workspace array in Xgremlin
<li> modify data in workspace (e.g. Fourier transform them)
<li> write modified data to file 
</ol>

The central workspace array in Xgremlin is called the <b>r</b>-array
(for reasons unknown). Many of the operations which modify data in the
<b>r</b>-array require temporary storage which is the purpose of the
<b>tr</b>-array (read: <b>temporary r</b>-array).  In addition to
these two arrays two more arrays exist. One, the <b>ffta-array</b> is used
for large Fourier transforms, the other is used in phase correction of
FT spectra and is therefore named the <b>phase</b>-array. The following
table summarizes the use of these four arrays in Xgremlin:

<dl>
<dt> <b>r</b>-array		
<dd> general purpose array, used in most
 operations. Contents can be plotted
 in a plotting window.<p>

<dt> <b>tr</b>-array		
<dd> companion to the <b>r</b>-array for temporary
 storage. Contents cannot be plotted
 but can be copied into the <b>r</b>-array
 for inspection (see e.g. <a href="commands/exchange.html">exchange</a> ).<p>

<dt> <b>ffta</b>-array             
<dd> solely used for Fourier transformation
 of interferograms.<p>

<dt> <b>phz</b>-array
<dd> solely used in phase corrections
 of FT spectra.
</dl>

<h3>Command/Edit window</h3>
Xgremlin has a command input window which allows to type in
commands to modify data in one (or more) of the data arrays.
All commands are described in this help file. The 
<a href="commands/button.html">button</a>
command may be used to assign these commands to a row of 
buttons seperating the command input window and the plot
window.
<p><br>

<h3>Plot window</h3>
The contents of the <b>r</b>-array can be plotted in a window above
the command input window in Xgremlin. A special set of commands (plot
mode commands) can be used to zoom into a plot to have a close look at
small details. See the <a href="plotmode.html">plot mode commands</a>
help topic for a list of all plot mode commands. The most important
plot mode commands are accessible via buttons on top of the plot
window.
<p><br>

<h3>Data files and header files</h3> 
Every data file in one of the NSO
formats must be accompanied by a so-called <b>header</b> file ( with
the file name extension <b>hdr</b> ) which contains all the
information needed for processing an interferogram, such as the alias,
fringe division ratio, number of points etc.
<p><br>

<h3>Unit names</h3> 
A symbolic name that is associated with a
particular file using the <a href="commands/open.html">open</a>
command.  See <a href="commands/open.html">open</a> for a list of all
valid names. The most common ones are the <b>rawin</b> unit (for
interferograms), the <b>datain</b> unit (for spectra) and the
<b>lineio</b> unit for line list files. Pure ASCII files do not
require a header file.
<p><br>


<h3>Internal line list</h3> 
Spectroscopists deal with spectral lines. Xgremlin has a number of
commands to create and modify line lists. Most important is the <a
href="commands/linelist.html>linelist</a> command which is used to
create a line list from a spectrum that has been loaded into the
<b>r</b>-array.  It is also possible to read the lines from a binary
line list file (the <b>.lin</b> file) using the <a
href="commands/getlines.html">getlines</a> command), or by <a
href="commands/findlines.html">findlines</a>.  It is destroyed by a <a
href="commands/read.html">read</a> command, but the lines can be saved
in the <b>.lin</b> file using <a
href="commands/putlines.html">putlines</a>.
<p><br>

<h3>Fourier transforms</h3>
In two sided interferograms, the centre
occurs roughly half way through the interferogram, and the FT
programs only use an equal number of points on either side of
the centre. If the centre is <b>significantly</b> away from the half
way point (e.g. 1/5 or 1/4 of the way through), the
interferogram should be treated as one-sided, so it is
multiplied by an amertising function to <b>balance it up</b>
before it is transformed.
<p><br>

<h3>Ringing lines</h3>
In an under-resolved spectrum, the instrument
function of the interferometer is an important contributor to
the line shape. This instrument function is the Fourier
transform of a top hat - namely a sinc function, and every
line in the spectrum will be convolved with this sinc
function. The positive and negative lobes of this function
appear in the wings of the line, and are referred to as
<b>ringing</b>.

<h3>Scratch directory</h3>
A directory with files for the persistent storage of data from the <b>r</b> 
array.
