<h2>Plot Mode Commands</h2><p>

The following commands are single or multiple key commands that can be
executed when Plotmode is activated. To get into plot mode either
press the <a href="tutorial/plotmode.html">Plotmode button</a> or
press the <b>Tab</b> key.  In both cases the Plotmode button will be
highlighted and depressed.<p>

Most of the important key commands are also associated with the
row of blue buttons along the top of the XGremlin window.
Those commands which let the user a section of a plot marked by two
markers are only accessible through the buttons.<p>

<b>Note:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>S+x</b> means: hold down the shift key while pressing key <b>x</b>
<li> <b>C+x</b> means: hold down the control key while pressing <b>x</b>
<li> <b>M</b> stands for a modifier key that is usually 
              the <b>Alt</b> key on PC type machines. Other keyboards
	      have different meta keys.
</ul><p><br>


<h3>Plotting and moving around:</h3>
<pre>
.	  move to the right, do not rescale y axis
>	  move  to the right and rescale y axis to fill plotter window
,	  move to the left, do not rescale y axis
<	  move to the left and rescale y axis to fill plotter window
z	  move zero line to the centre of the plot
e	  move zero line to bottom edge of the plot
x	  zoom in horizontally around centre of window or marker
	  zoom factor is 0.5, zoom in
S+x       zoom factor 0.25, zoom in
C+x       zoom factor 0.1, zoom in
M+x       zoom out horizontally around centre of window or marker
y	  zoom in vertically around zero line or marker, zoom factor 0.5
S+y       zoom factor 0.25, zoom in
C+y       zoom factor 0.1, zoom in
M+y       zoom out vertically around zero line
^	  full scale in y direction, data fill window in y direction
p         (lower case 'p') overplot the current content of the r
	  array onto the current plot.
C+r       exchange r and tr arrays, then overplot the contents of 
          the r array.	
S+p	  replot. Optionally  put zeroline where the cursor marker is set.
S+u	  undo last plot mode operation.
</pre><p><br>

<h3>Plot modes:</h3>
<pre>
n	  normal plot. No complex data, r array contains real data
r	  r array contains complex data, plot real part only
i	  r array contains complex data, plot imaginary part only
c	  r array contains complex data, plot real and imag part	
</pre><p><br>

<h3>Line list related commands:</h3>
<pre>
S+a       make all lines in the current line buffer 'active'
C+a       add the (cursor-)marked line(s) to the line list
C+d       delete (drop) a marked line from the linelist.
C+s       use last marked line for width, damping etc. 
          of future added lines
C+t       toggle a line active or inactive
v         move a marked line. The line to be moved must be 
          marked with a red marker (left mouse button), the
          new position must be marked with a blue marker
          (middle mouse button).
S+v       toggle all lines visible or invisible on the screen
g         calculate the centre of gravity between two markers
	  and print it in the text window. The c.g. is not 
	  inserted into the line list.
C+g       same as 'g' command but the resulting c.g. is also 
	  used as the line position and inserted into the 
	  internal line list.
m         print information about the line marked with a red
          cursor marker (middle mouse button).
a,o       mark all lines in the current plotter window with
          line markers.
w         First mark the edge of a line. The 'w' command will then
	  find the corresponding 'other edge', calculate and print
          out the width of the line and the bisector of both edges
          of the line. The centroid (= bisector) is marked with an 
	  auxiliary marker.
C+w       same as 'w' command but also inserts the line into the 
          internal line list
M+C+g     do a 'getlines inactive'. This will overwrite all 
          data in the linelist buffer (hence the inconvenient key
          combination).

<h3>Line intensity related commands:</h3>
<pre>
M+a	  execute an 'area' command to determine the area between
          two cursor markers.
</pre><p><br>

<h3>Miscellaneous:</h3>
<pre>
S+c       find the center of an interferogram in r and display it
C+z       set to zero the r-array between two mouse markers.
N	  put polynomial through 1-3 (cursor-)marked point(s)
          and normalize to 1.0 .
B         put ploynomial through 1-3 (cursor-)marked point(s)
          and subtract from data.
#         print 11 points around each cursor marker in the
          text window.
M+c       connect two or more markers by a straight line and put 
          the result into the r array.
M+d       print the distance between two mouse markers in points
          and wavenumbers
l         replace a set (red) marker bye a wavenumber label
          (primary units)
M+l       replace a set marker by a label in secondary units
          nm, Hz or GHz.
u	  cycle secondary units through nm, Hz and GHz.
	  The position in secondary units is displayed in 
	  brackets after the wavenumber in the plotting 
          window.
M+w 	  calculate the wavelength/number difference between
	  two mouse markers and set the line 'width' parameter
	  to the result.
@	  read 2048 points from a datafile (connected to the
	  unit 'datain') centered at a previously set mouse
   	  marker.
M+b       write deleted phase points to bad points file.
