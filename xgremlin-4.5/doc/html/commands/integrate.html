<h2>integrate</h2><p>

<b>Syntax:</b> <kbd>integrate</kbd><p>

This command will calculate the integral of a line between two markers
that have first been set. The line shape has to be defined with the <a
href="profile.html">profile</a> command first. The fitted line profile will
be plotted over the data for comparison and the residumm will be
plotted ( except when profile type is 'none' ).
<p><br>

<h3>Fitting and integrating one or more Gauss profiles</h3>
The range of integration must be specified by setting pairs of 
mouse markers with the left mouse button. All data points inside
those pairs of markers will be included in the fit. The first and
last mouse marker enclose the whole range for which the theoretical
profile will be calculated.
Initial position and intensity (height) of each line to 
be fitted must be specified with middle button mouse markers.
The initial with and the tolerance for the least squares fit
are set with the following commands:
<pre>
   set width <width>
   set lsqtol <number>    (default is 1.e-6)
</pre>
<p><br>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
    set width 0.015
    set lsqtol 1.e-7
    integrate
</pre>
