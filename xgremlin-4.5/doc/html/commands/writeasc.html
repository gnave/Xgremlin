<h2>writeasc</h2>
<h3>Syntax :</h3>  <br> writeasc <i>&lt;output file&gt;</i> [<i>&lt;first point&gt; &lt;last point&gt;</i>] [ <i>&lt;comment line character</i>&gt; ]
         [ <i>&lt;title string for GLE&gt;</i> ] </i></h3>

	writes out a portion of the r array between two point in ASCII
	suitable for reading into programs such as GLE, Gnuplot,
	a spreadsheet program or some other data plotting program.
	Real data are written in two columns as x-y pairs, complex data
	are written out in three columns. The beginning of the file	
	consists of a number of comment lines with by default start with
	a '!' character. The comment line character can be changed with
	the 'writeasc' command. If the range of points is omitted from the 
	command the range that is currently visible in the plotting window
	will be written to the file.
<p>
	The 'writeasc' command provides a convenient interface to GLE.
	The first string variable in a 'writeasc' command must always be 
	the output file name of the data file. If the second string on the 
 	command line does NOT begin with a comment character the string 
	is assumed to be the title of a plot to be created with the 
	GLE plotting program. In this case Xgremlin also creates a suitable 
	input file for the GLE plotting program which includes the 
	previously created data file. Real data and the real part of complex
	data are plotted in black whereas the imaginary part of complex
	data is plotted in blue as in the Xgremlin plot window.

<h3>	Examples:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>	<b>	 writeasc test.dat "#" 100 300		</b>
<dd>		   writes points 100 - 300 from the r array into the file
		   'test.dat' using a '#' for the comment lines. The data
		   file 'test.dat' would be suitable for reading into	
		   Gnuplot.
<p>
<dt>	<b>	 writeasc test.dat 200 5000 "A test spectrum" </b>
<dd>		   writes points 100 - 5000 from the r array to the 
		   file 'test.dat' and also writes a file 'test.gle'
		   which can be processed by the plotting program GLE.
