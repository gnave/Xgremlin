<b>Syntax</b><br>
<ul>
<li> <b>Cutoff - filter:</b> <kbd>filter &lt;nrise&gt &lt;ncut&gt</kbd>
<li> <b>Gaussian filter:</b> <kbd>filter &lt;nrise&gt &lt;ncut&gt &lt;width&gt gauss</kbd>
<li> <b>Boxcar filter:</b>   <kbd>filter &lt;nrise&gt &lt;ncut&gt &lt;width&gt boxcar</kbd>
<li> <b>Voigt filter:</b>    <kbd>filter &lt;nrise&gt &lt;ncut&gt &lt;ampnoise&gt voigt</kbd>
</ul>

These four forms of the filter command invoke different types of filters (see below).
The meaning of the command parameters is:

<dl>
<dt> <b>nrise</b>
<dd> rise width of cosine bell to avoid end effects<p>

<dt> <b>ncut</b>
<dd> cut off frequency of the FFT<p>

<dt> <b>ampnoise</b>
<dd> magnitude of the transform at the cutoff frequency <b>ncut</b>
     of the Voigt filter. It is a measure for the noise amplitude.<p>

<dt> <b>width</b>
<dd>  the width of the gaussian or boxcar filters
</dl>

Filter the data by taking the transform, apply a particular filter
shape and the take the inverse transform. The ends of the original
data are first multiplied by a cosine bell of width <b>nrise</b>, to
bring it smoothly down to zero and hence avoid any end effects (see <a
href="mask.html"> mask</a>). A value of <b>nop/10</b> is usually
sufficient.<p>

The first form uses a sharp cut-off filter which sets all values in
the transform of the data in the <b>r</b> array to zero above the
point <b>ncut</b>. Since the filter drops abruptly to zero at
<b>ncut</b>, this results in ringing around the lines, and hence it is
probably not particularly useful.<p>

The second form uses a gaussian filter of width <b>width</b>. This is
often useful to suppress ringing around lines (i.e. the lobes of the
sinc function which appear in the wings of strong lines) caused by
under-resolution. In this case, values of <b>width = 2 or 3</b> are
usually sufficient. <b>ncut</b> should be equal to the number of points in
the transform at which it drops to zero. To determine this, transform
the data using <a href="fourtran.html">fourtran</a> and plot it. Then
place the cursor over the point at which the plot drops to zero and
use the displayed point value as <b>ncut</b>.<p>

The third form applies a boxcar filter of a specified <b>width</b>.
<b>width</b> and <b>ncut</b> should be determined in the same way
as with the gaussian filter.<p>

The fourth form uses a voigt filter. <b>nrise</b> should be half the
value of the point where the transform drops to zero, and
<b>ampnoise</b> should be the value of the transform at this half way
point. These should be determined in the same way as with the
gaussian filter.<p>

The filter commands do change the data, sometimes in rather 
unexpected ways. So it is advisable to examine the results carefully 
to ensure you have exactly what you require.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<dl>
<dt> <kbd>filter 100 100</kbd>
<dd> apply a simple cut-off filter to data in the <b>r</b> array.<p>
<dt> <kbd>filter 100 100 90. gauss</kbd>
<dd> apply a gaussian filter of width 90 and cutoff 100 to data in the 
     <b>r</b> array. The first and last 100 points of the data are masked
     with a cosine bell.<p>
