<h3>Syntax:</h3>
readasc <em> &lt;filename&gt; [&lt;x-column&gt; &lt;y-column&gt;
&lt;z-column&gt;] ['add'] </em> 
<p>
this command is used to load data files in multi column ASCII format
into the r array. <b>The data must be evenly spaced</b> on the
wavenumber or wavelength scale. Lines beginning with the characters
<b>#</b>, <b>;</b> or <b>!</b> are comment lines. When the option
'add' is present the data in the file will be added to the contents of
the 'r' array. Default is to overwrite the contents of the 'r'
array. <b>In order for data adding to work the wavenumber / wavelength
grid must be the same in all added files.</b>
<p>

<b>Note:</b><br>
The variable 'nwos' can be assigned a value in a comment. 
If nwos is set to 1 then the x axis is assumed to be in  wavelengths; 
if nwos is set to -1 the x axis is assumed to be in wavenumbers. The 
default is nwos = 1 that is a wavelength scale. 



<h3>Examples: </h3>
A typical data file may look as follows:
<pre>
# This is a sample data file loadable into Xgremlin
# using the 'readasc' command
# nwos 1
1.5	10.0	1.0
3.0	20.0	4.0
4.5	30.0	9.0
; this line is a comment too
6.0	40.0	16.0
</pre>
This file can be read in with the following commands:

<DL>
<DT> <b>readasc test.dat</b>
<DD> will read the first 2 columns of the file 'test.dat' 
assuming the first column contains wavenumbers (or wavelengths)
and the second column intensity data.<p>

<dt> <b>readasc test.dat 2 1</b>
<dd>will read the first 2 columns of the file 'test.dat'
assuming that the 2nd column contains wavenumbers.<p>

<dt> <b>readasc test.dat 1 3</b>
<dd>will read the numbers in the third column of 'test.dat'
as intensity data.<p>

<dt> <b>readasc test.dat 1 3 2</b>
<dd>read data in file 'test.dat' as complex data.<p>

<dt> <b>readasc test.dat 1</b>
<dd>will read a single column from 'test.dat' only. This command
must also be used if the file contains no more than a single
column of data.<p>

<dt> <b>readasc test.dat <br>
readasc test2.dat add</b>
<dd>the first command will read the first two colunms of data 
in the file 'test.dat' and store them in the 'r' array.
The second command will add the data in file 'test2.dat' 
to the data of 'test.dat' in the 'r' array.<p>
