<h2>kernel</h2><p>

<b>Syntax:</b> <kbd>kernel newnop</kbd><p>

The kernel function is assumed to be in the <b>r</b> array.  It is
masked, stretched to <b>newnop</b> points, and transformed; the transform
is phased so that the center of gravity is at nop/2 + 1.
This command was designed to permit matching the
length of an instrumental profile scan to the scans which are to
be deconvolved using the instrumental profile, but may be used
for any kernel function to be used for convolution or
restoration.<p>

<b>Note:</b><br>
Unlike in MS/DOS - Gremlin the resulting kernel is <b>not</b> automatically
saved in the ffta array because there may be no ffta array 
allocated when the <b>kernel</b> command is typed in.
