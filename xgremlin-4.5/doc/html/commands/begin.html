Only effective after a <a href = "set.html">set batch</a> command.

A sequencing instruction included so that an entire run need
not be aborted in case of an error.  This command does not
stop terminations which arise from system problems.  If a
syntax error is encountered, the remaining commands are scanned
until either a "begin" or an "end" command is found.  The "end"
command terminates the run while the "begin" indicates that
the commands which follow are not dependent upon the success
of the previous commands.  All status is saved.(eg. saves, etc)
