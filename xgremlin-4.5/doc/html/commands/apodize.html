<b>Syntax:</b> apodize  <i> [ &lt width &gt ] </i>
<p><br>

Where <i>width</i> is the number of points of a cosine bell applied
to the ends of the interferogram. The default width is <b>5%</b> of 
the longer side of the interferogram. The <b>apodize</b> command is
usually employed in  batch files.<p> 

Interferograms should be apodized i.e., the ends of the data
are brought smoothly down to zero at the ends before
transforming. The data is usually padded out with zeros to bring
the number of points up to a power of 2 so it can be
transformed. If the ends of the interferogram are not first
brought down to zero before padding, there will be a jump in the
interferogram actually transformed (remember that the discrete Fourier
transform is periodic), which will introduce

around the lines.<p>

Xgremlin has two sets of commands relating to Fourier transforms. One
set is used for smaller transforms in the <b>r</b> array, the other is
used for large transforms in the <b>ffta</b> array. The <b>apodize</b>
command is used for apodizing during large Fourier transforms. For
apodizing prior to small transforms in the <b>r</b> array the
<a href="/usr/local/xgremlin/html/commands/mask.html"> mask </a>
command must be used.<p><br>
