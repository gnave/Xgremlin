<h2>moments</h2><p>

<b>Syntax:</b> <kbd>moments [n]</kbd><p>

calculate the first <b>n</b> discrete central moments of a line (default n=3).
The definition of moments used by the program is:
<pre>          
            k=C+I
            ____
            \                         n-1 
   E(n)  =   >     ( delw* ( k - C ) )     r(k)
            /	
            ----
            k=C-I

   C    : center of the line
   I    : half of the range of integration
   delw : wave-number/length dispersion
   r    : data in the r array
</pre>

E(1) is simply the area of the line as calculated by the <a
href="area.html">area</a> command.  The higher moments (particularly
the 2nd and 3rd) provide a very sensitive measure of the asymmetry of
a line. For a symmetric line E(2) = 0. An asymmetry that is hard to
discern on a plot of the data may produce a 2nd moment with 1/10 of
the magnitude of the 1st moment.  The <b>moments</b> command requires 2
markers to be set before it can be entered. The first marks the center
of the line, the second marks how far out the integration should be
carried out. The moments are printed together with moments scaled such
that E(1) = 1 (that latter often being more useful).
