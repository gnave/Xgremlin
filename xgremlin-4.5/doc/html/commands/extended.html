<b>Command forms:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> extended <b>absorbance</b> [wstart wstop]
<li> extended <b>add</b> isave [wstart wstop] 
<li> extended <b>bin</b> [wstart wstop]
<li> extended <b>exp</b> [wstart wstop]
<li> extended <b>high-res-ratio</b> [wstart wstop]
<li> extended <b>log</b> [wstart wstop]
<li> extended <b>max</b> [wstart wstop]
<li> extended <b>min</b> [wstart wstop]
<li> extended <b>multiply</b> wstart wstop constant
<li> extended <b>ratio</b> isave wstart wstop wcorr
</ul>

A set of commands which copy the input file to the output file after
performing some operation on it. In many cases the set of 'extended'
commands is not needed any more because it was designed to deal with
large spectra on machines with little memory. The operands are
described below, command parameters are:

<ul>
<li> <b>wstart</b>: starting wavenumber
<li> <b>wstop</b>: stopping wavenumber
<li> <b>isave</b>: <a href="save.html">save</a> number of low resolution function
</ul>

<b>Warning:</b><br>
If some other old file has been opened which has its own,
header file which is different to the high resolution file
(e.g., by opening a second file for adding or ratioing), then
care must be taken to have the high-res header information in
memory when add, ratio or worm is executed; either open datain
last or do any read from datain. Some commands may be terminated
prematurely but cleanly by pressing the <b>Stop</b> button. Default 
wstart and wstop are taken from the .hdr file.<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>extended absorbance wstart wstop</b><br>
<dd>Take the negative of the log of the file on <b>datain</b>, write to <b>dataout</b>
(i.e. dataout = -log(datain) ). 
<b><a href="create.html">create</a> must be executed first.</b><p>

<dt><b>extended add isave wstart wstop</b>
<dd>Add a low resolution function which has been saved in isave to
the data file on datain and write the result to dataout. The low
resolution function is interpolated to the same scale as the
input file.
<b><a href="create.html">create</a> must be executed first.</b><p>

<dt><b>extended bin [wstart wstop]</b>
<dd>Create low resolution spectrum of averaged bins of file on
<b>datain</b>. Output is in <b>r</b> and saved in 19.  Filtering is used
to kill ringing.

<dt><b>extended exp [wstart wstop]</b>
<dd>Take the exponential of the file on <b>datain</b>, write to <b>dataout</b><p>

<dt><b>extended high-res-ratio [wstart wstop]</b>
<dd>Ratio a data file on <b>datain</b> to another high resolution
function on <b>altdata</b> and write the result to <b>dataout</b>.
<b><a href="create.html">create</a> must be executed first.</b>
<b>Warning:
Watch order in which files are opened - datain must come last.</b><p>

<dt><b>extended log [wstart wstop]</b>
<dd>Take the logarithm of the file on <b>datain</b>, write to <b>dataout</b>
<b><a href="create.html">create</a> must be executed first.</b><p>

<dt><b>extended max [wstart wstop]</b>
<dd>Create low resolution spectrum of filtered maxima of file on
<b>datain</b>. Output is in <b>r</b> and saved in 19.  Filtering is used
to kill ringing.<p>

<dt><b>extended min [wstart wstop]</b>
<dd>Create low resolution spectrum of filtered minima of file on
<b>datain</b>. Output is in <b>r</b> and saved in 19.  Filtering is used
to kill ringing.<p>

<dt><b>extended multiply [wstart wstop] constant</b>
<dd>Multiply the file on <b>datain</b> by constant, write to <b>dataout</b>
<b><a href="create.html">create</a> must be executed first.</b><p>

<dt><b>extended ratio isave [wstart wstop] </b>
<dd>Ratio a data file on <b>datain</b> to a low resolution function saved
in isave and write the result to <b>dataout</b>.
<b><a href="create.html">create</a> must be executed first.</b><p>
