<b>Syntax: </b>alias <i>[ &lt newname &gt &lt string &gt ]</i>
<p>

An unfortunately-named command that has nothing to do with
aliasing in FT spectra, but is a way to execute a set of
several other commands by means of a single word; similar to
the <b>alias</b> command in various Unix shells.<p>

The string <i>newname</i> will become the new command; it will be
expanded to <i>string</i> in the command line at execution time, but
need not be the last command on the line.  If no new name is
given, this command will simply list the existing aliases.<p>

The string may include several commands separated by semicolons,
but only the last one will have access to further parameters in
the original command line.  An alias may use another alias.<p>

<b>Currently no more than 50 aliases are allowed,</b> 
no erasure is possible once aliases are defined.
<i>newname</i> is limited to 12 characters, <i>string</i> 
may be up to 80 chars,
but the final expansion for all aliases in the line is limited
to 256 characters.<p><br>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<dl>
<dt> <b>alias sc "sinc 20. 400;plot"</b>
<dd> makes <b>sc</b> an alias for <b>sinc 20. 400;plot</b>
<dt> <b>alias wu "whats up"</b>
<dd> try it out
</dl>
<p><br>

<h3>Note:</h3>
Strings containing blank spaces must be enclosed in "quotes" to ensure
that Xgremlin interprets them as one single string.
