	Portable machine parameter library
        ----------------------------------

	The MPAR library contains functions to calculate machine 
	constants such as the smallest floating point number that can
	be represented etc. 

        i1mach, r1mach and d1mach are drop-in replacements for the machine 
        constant databases from Argonne National Lab which have become 
        largely obsolete (they are e.g required by the MINPACK library). 
        The functions [ird]1mach in libMPAR are based on the subroutines 
	[sd]machar which calculate machine constants on arbitrary
	machines (W J Cody, MACHAR: A subroutine to dynamically determine
	machine parameters, TOMS 14, 1988). 

	The new functions  spmpar  and  dpmpar  which replace the older
	r1mach and d1mach functions are also available.
	 
	NOTE:
	The function i1mach assumes 32-bit integer arithmetic. If a 
	different integer width is used a few constants in the source
	code must be changed.
