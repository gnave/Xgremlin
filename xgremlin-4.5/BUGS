        Undesirable features we know of:
	--------------------------------

	* At least some Sparcstations running SunOS 4.1.3 come with an 
	X server that has flaws and does not display the grips for resizing
	panes correctly. Only the upper half of the grips show up on the 
	display. This could be caused by a X11R5 server running a R6 client.
	Fix: unknown.


	Please report bugs to
