<h1>  The raw phase plot </h1>

In the phase plot, the spectrum is represented in black and the phase
points, going from +pi to -pi, are in red. 
Both spectrum and phase can be expanded with the buttons at the top of
the <a href="../tutorial/gremlin_figure.html"> gremlin window</a>. To
expand the spectrum vertically, make sure that the 'phase' button is not
highlighted. If this button is red, then you will expand the phase
plot instead. If you only expand in the wavenumber direction, then
both the spectrum and phase are expanded together.

In this phase plot, all of the points line on a well-defined line,
with no 2-pi phase flips or false points caused by ghosts or foldback.

In this plot, there is a 2-pi phase flip, caused by using a wrong
value for the central point. A single polynomial cannot be fitted to
this phase, and to correct it you should go back to the phase window
and change the value used for the central point. Alternatively, you
can correct a problem like this by multiplying the interferogram by
-1. This is done with the command
<a href="../commands/input.html"><b>input inverted</b></a>, which is
bound to the 'Invert interferogram' button in the plot window.

In this plot, the general phase is well-behaved, but there are false
points caused by <a href="../glossary.html"> foldback</a> 
from other aliases and by 
<a href="../glossary.html">laser ghosts</a>. These must be
removed by surrounding them with two markers and deleting them with
&lt;Ctrl+d&gt; (usually bound to the button 'delete' if you are using
the default mappings for the buttons).
