\subsection{A Few Useful Commands} \label{sec:useful}

These descriptions are mainly taken from the help file.

\subsubsection{alias}
{\tt alias newname "string"}\\
{\tt alias}\\
        newname   will become a new command; it will be expanded to
        ``string'' in the command line at execution time, but need not be
        the last command on the line.  If no newname is given, this
        command will simply list the existing aliases. The string may
        include several commands separated by semicolons, but only the
        last one will have access to further parameters in the original
        command line.  An alias may use another alias.

	Newname is limited to 12 characters; string may be up to 80 chars,
	but the final expansion for all aliases in the line is limited
	to 127 characters.

\subsubsection{info}
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt info}]
        on its own gives a summary of the information block.
        Alternatively type
        for the value of {\em var}. The help file lists the variables
        that {\em info} knows about.
\item[{\tt info}\/ {\em var} {\em value}]
        sets  {\em var} to {\em value}. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{set}

{\tt set xreg(i)}\/ {\em xnum}\\
{\tt set ireg(i)}\/ {\em inum}\\
{\tt set ireg(i) up}\/ {\em inum}\\
{\tt set xreg(i) down}\/ {\em xnum}\\
        There are ten integer and ten floating registers - ireg(i) and
        xreg(i), i=0-9.  These registers can be used anywhere in a
        command  (even ``set'') as if they were numbers. They are
        initialized by using the command without modifiers; by using the
        modifiers ``up'', ``down'', ``times'' and ``over'' the registers
        can be modified at will.  For example:

        \begin{description}
           \item[{\tt set xreg(2) 30000.}]   will set register 2 to 30000.0, and
           \item[{\tt set xreg(2) up 100.}]  will increase it by 100 to 30100.  Then
           \item[{\tt read xreg(2)} ]        will read a record starting at 30100.
        \end{description}

        If used without a subscript (i.e., just xreg or ireg), the
        default is 0.

        There are a number of variables and flags that can be set. Full
        information is in the help file. Some handy ones are:

        \begin{description}
          \item[{\tt set centerread}\/ {\em wstart}] signifies that
             the next read command {\em read wref}\/ will read a buffer
             centred around {\em wstart} 
          \item[{\tt set firstread} \/ {\em wstart}] signifies that 
             the next read command will read a buffer beginning at {\em wstart}.
          \item[{\tt set width}\/ {\em width}] so width is the values set
             for all lines subsequently included via the plot routine.
          \item[{\tt set readlength} {\em value}] will set the number
	     of points read in by the next {\em read} statement to {\em value}
        \end{description}

\subsubsection{whats}
        \begin{description}
         \item[{\tt whats saved}]
                            lists the contents of the scratch file
                            (written by the command {\tt save}\/ {\em inum}.
         \item[{\tt whats xreg(inum)} and
               {\tt whats ireg(inum)}]
                            lists the values of the registers as set
                            in {\tt set}.
         \item[{\tt whats r}\/ {\em n m}] lists the values in the r
		array between points n and m.
         \item[{\tt whats tr}\/ {\em n m}] lists the values in the tr
                array between points n and m.
        \end{description}

\subsubsection{save and recall}
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt save}\/ {\em n}  ] saves up to 8192 points of the r array in label {\em n} in
                        the scratch file.
\item[{\tt recall}\/ {\em n}] recalls  the contents of {\em n} into the r
                        array.
