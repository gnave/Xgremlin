Lines from a Fourier transform spectrometer are on a linear wavenumber
scale determined by the control laser. However since the laser and the
source follow different paths in a spectrometer the output needs to be
corrected by a geometric factor. This factor is stored in the
variable <em>wavcorr</em> and uses the formula:
<IMG align=bottom height=15 SRC="wavcorr_form.gif">
to put all the wavenumbers on an absolute scale. To use it, calculate
the required correction factor by finding the fractional difference 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM height=15 alt="" SRC="delta_sigma.gif"> where 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM height= 13 ALT="" SRC="delsig.gif"> is
the difference between the wavenumber of a standard line in your
uncalibrated spectrum and the known wavenumber of that line (In
principle you only need one standard line but we recommend that you
use more). Then type
<A HREF="../commands/info.html"> <b>info wavcorr</b></A> <em>wavcorr</em>
Subsequent linelists will then have the correct wavenumbers. To keep
this value permanently, it should be entered into the appropriate space
in the header.
