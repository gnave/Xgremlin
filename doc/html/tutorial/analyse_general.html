<H2> General Procedure</H2>

This section describes the processes involved in converting a spectrum
from the FTS into a linelist. Most of the commands will only work on a
spectrum containing only the real part, but it may be advisable to
check the file containing the complex spectrum as well, just to ensure
the phase correction has been performed correctly.

The general procedure is as follows:
<dl>

<a href="analyse_real.html">
<dt>Check phase and create a real spectrum </a>
<dd> You may already have done this after performing the transform,
but if not, you should do it now

<a href="analyse_initial.html">
<dt>Subtract Continuum </a>
<dd> If you have a continuum on your spectrum, the next thing to do is
subtract it. If you do not, you will get the wrong intensities for the
lines, as the routines attempt to make the residual intensity zero
across the line profile. Here is
<a href="analyse_contin.html"> an example</a>

<a href="analyse_find.html">
<dt>Search for lines  </a>
<dd> Xgremlin can automatically searches for lines, but often has a
slightly different idea about what constitutes a line to your idea. So
it is necessary to go through the spectrum and check what it has done,
correcting it where necessary.

<a href="analyse_fit.html">
<dt>Fit  lines </a>
<dd> For most purposes, this can also be done automatically, but if
there is an area of the spectrum that you are particularly interested
in that has many blended lines, it might be worth doing this by hand.

<a href="analyse_cal.html>
<dt> Calibrate Wavenumbers </a>
<dd> The final linelist output from gremlin can be wavenumber
corrected and can also be corrected for the refractive index of air if
you have had to run your spectrometer in air (NOT
recommended!). 


<a href="analyse_inten.html>
<dt> Calibrate Intensites </a>
<dd> Intensity calibration can also be performed using a
low-resolution response function extracted from e.g. a tungsten or
deuterium lamp spectrum.
