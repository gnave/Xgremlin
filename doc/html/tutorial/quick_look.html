<h1> A first quick look at your spectrum </h1>

When you are taking your first interferograms, you may not wish to go
through the rigmarole of a full Fourier transform with interactive
phase correction if all you are interested in is whether things are
behaving properly. In this case the best thing is to just read in the
central section of an interferogram you have acquired, do a
medium-sized transform and look at the amplitude spectrum. 
Even when you have done a full transform and phase correction,  there
may be times when you do not want to find and fit lines in the
whole spectrum at one time - if you only need to look at one section of
it, or if you want to do a better job on the phase correction than was
originally done. In this case, it is possible to work on single buffers.
The lines found are not stored in a separate file, but can be written to
an ASCII file and read back in at a later date.
<p>
The first thing to do is to find the centre of the interferogram. This
is done by reading in a section of the interferogram and searching it
for the centre. Do this using the 
<b><a href="../commands/open.html">
open</a> datain </b> and 
<a href="../commands/read.html">
<b> read</b></a>
commands described under the section
<a href="../tutorial/first_see.html">
General Construction</a>. The next step is to
read in a section of the interferogram centred on this point, making
sure that the number of points read in is a power of 2, which is
required for the Fourier transform. First type
<b><a href="../commands/set.html">
set</a> centerread</b>, to ensure that the value you type in for the
read command will be centred in the plot, and then read in the data
using
<b><a href="../commands/read.html">
read</a></b> <em>f1 n1</em>, where f1 is the centre you have found and
n1 is a power of 2.
<a href="../commands/fourtran.html">
<b>fourtran</b></a> performs the Fourier transform, leaving the
<a href="../commands/glossary.html">
amplitude</a> spectrum in the lower half of the <em>r</em> array and
the complex spectrum in the <em>tr</em> array. The upper half of the
<em>r</em> array contains phase information. The maximum value of 
<em> n1</em> is defined by the size of the <em>r</em>
array, and can be increased with the 
<b><a href="../commands/alloc.html">
alloc</a></b> command.

The complex spectrum in the <em>tr</em> array can be displayed by
first transferring the data to the <em>r</em> array using
<b><a href="../commands/exchange.html">
exchange</a></b> and then typing
<b><a href="../commands/plot.html">
plot</a></b>.

<p>
The phase of the resulting spectrum will probably be incorrect, but it is
possible to correct the phase on a line-by-line basis. First, find the
line that you wish to phase correct, and note  two point numbers, <em>
n1</em> and <em> n2</em> on either side of it between which you think you
probably have good phase information. Then type:
<b><a href="../commands/cmplx.html">
cmplx</a> linecorr</b> <em> n1 n2</em>
to correct the phase. The default number of points is the whole
buffer, which may or may not be useful, depending on whether you have
mainly signal (i.e. continuum spectrum) or noise! This is the most
useful command for correcting
the phase of a specific section, although there are other commands
listed in the help file under 
<b><a href="../commands/cmplx.html">
cmplx</a></b>. However for a quick look,
it is often best to ignore the whole thing and just use the amplitude
spectrum, unless of course you are interested in what the phase looks
like! You can save an ASCII file of the <em>r</em> array with the
command
<b><a href="../commands/writefile.html">
writefile</a></b> <em>filename</em>, or simply save the data to the
scratch directory using
<b><a href="../commands/save.html">
save</b></a> <em>filenum</em>, where <em>filenum</em> is a number to
designate where the data goes. The scratch file is kept intact between
the various runs of Xgremlin.

<p>
It is possible to make a quick list of all the lines in the current
buffer above an intensity <em>disc</em> by typing
<b><a href="../commands/findlines.html">
findlines</a></b> <em>disc</em>. You can then plot them and select the
ones you wish to add or discard as before. 

<p>
<b>findlines</b> usually fits the wavenumbers of the lines quite well, unless
there are blends present, but does not do such a good job with the
intensities and widths. To fit them, you must first subtract the
initial fit from the spectrum, to generate a set of residuals. This is
done with the command
<b><a href="../commands/active.html">
active</a></b>. Then you can run 
<b><a href="../commands/lsqfit.html">
lsqfit</a></b> <em> n</em>,
where n specifies the number of iterations you want for the least
squares fitting. <b>active</b> and <b>lsqfit</b> are run automatically by
<b><a href="../commands/fitlines.html">
fitlines</a></b> when you fit a whole spectrum. <b>lsqfit</b> leaves the
residuals from the fit in the r array, so you can check how well they
have been fitted. They should be down to the noise level. Deviations
indicate that the lines are either ringing, are blended with other lines
you have not included, or are self-absorbed.

<p>
To display the parameters of the lines you have found, there are two
commands:
<b><a href="../commands/dispar.html">
dispar</a></b> and
<b><a href="../commands/printparams.html">
printparams</a></b>.
To save them in a file so that they can be read in later, use
<b><a href="../commands/writeparams.html">
writeparams</a></b> <em>filename</em>
This saves them in a file with the Xgremlin commands for reading them back
in, so to recall them you need just say
<b><a href="../commands/run.html">
run</a></b> <em> filename</em>.
