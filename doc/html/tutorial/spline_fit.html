<h1> Spline fits in Xgremlin </h1>

The phase of the interferogram sometimes cannot be adequately fitted using a polynomial. This is often the case for high signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the NIST 2-m FTS, where a kink in the phase around 9000 cm-1 is often observed. In this case, the phase must be fitted with a spline.
<p>
Fitting of the phase with a spline is sometimes tricky and it may be necessary 
to play around with the parameters controlling the spline to achieve good 
results. Ensure that all of the points lie on a smooth curve before attempting a spline fit. Points off the curve will cause the spline fit to fail and sometimes freeze. If this happens, the spline fitting can be terminated with the <b> stop </b> button in the main Xgremlin window.
<p>
The parameters controlling the spline phase fit are set by <a 
href="../commands/info.html">info</a>) and are as follows:

<dt> stol <dd> (default is 1.0) tolerance for the fit. Must be between 0 and 1. 
If stol = 0, the spline is an interpolating spline (goes through the points). 
Values of stol larger than 0 describe how closely the approximating spline 
approaches the data 
points.

<dt> sten <dd> (default is 0.) tension factor for the fit. The tension factor 
must be positive. If sten = 0, the spline is a normal cubic spline.

<dt> smof <dd> (default is 0.) smoothing factor. The larger this factor, the 
larger the degree of smoothing.

<dt> swid <dd> (default is 6) Set this above zero to ensure that only one point 
is picked up per line. Default is 6.  Use only the phase from the largest 
amplitude point within swid points.
