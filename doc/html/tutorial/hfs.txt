I am sending a set of files which are listed below and some notes
on running the hfs analysis program in gremlin.  I suggest that
you try the example session before reading in detail the notes
since things become clearer on trying the program out.
If you have questions please email me.

This letter refers to files placed on ferrum in directory juliet:

SUBROUTINE  COLSQ
ANNEAL version from Numerical Recipes

 Gremlin contains the following options:

option hfs <parameter filename>
option hfs <parameter filename> anneal
option hfs <parameter filename> show
option hfs <parameter filename> multiplet


The option hfs is used with selected spectral
lines to determine values of hyperfine structure splitting
factors A and B of the levels involved in a transition.
I give below a typical parameter input file of
standard format called m006c01.
This is the parameter file required for the anneal (or default)
option.


The default is anneal.
SHOW - If show is selected the pattern is merely displayed that would have
       been produced by the numbers in the parameter file - no fitting is
       carried out at all.
MULTIPLET - multiplet is a routine which can be used to simplify the making
       of the parameter input file if a multiplet is analysed.  This will be
       discussed in further detail later.

Description of input file example m006c01

line 1 : a label containing the multiplet number (m006), a description
of the transition and the name of the spectrum (rn23).
line 2: Four integers
-    J value of upper energy level
-    J value of lower energy level
-    ion label   eg 1 for neutral Co
     ion = 1 Co I, = 2 Co II, = 3 Co III, = 4 Co IV

-    cutoff -  This is obtained by reading in 32, 64 etc points
    of the line in gremlin and then running the fourtran program
    and plotting the result.  The transform should fall to 0 at
    a certain value of points (press  t  when in plot mode for
    display in points).  The number of points at the zero intensity
    is the value you enter for cutoff.  In this example it is 8 points.
    The calculated hfs pattern is sharp-cutoff filtered to this
    frequency.

line 3:  9 integers 0 or 1
         The is a command line which sets the program parameters to
         be active or inactive.  A zero means the value is fixed
         and 1 means that the parameter is to be varied.
         These correspond to the line of values in line 4.

line 4: 9 floating point numbers
-       area - (sum of points) found using 'area' subroutine
-       COG wavenumber  - wavenumber of COG of line (^ctrl G)
-       Gaussian (mK)
-       Lorentzian (mK)
-       A upper level mK
-       B upper level mK
-       A lower level mK
-       B lower level mK
-       saturation parameter  (optional).  Set to zero but is
        only important for the resonance lines.  If anneal tries
        to make it negative, make it inactive by setting a zero in
        the command line 3.

line 5:  anneal parameters T, niter, Tredfac
         T - is an analogue of temperature, but is of order 1 - 100
         niter - is the number of iterations at a given T ( 6-10)
         Tredfac - is the factor by which T is reduced before the
         next cycle (small factors .3 - .5 see to work best).

ANNEAL
For a description of "anneal" mode see Numerical Recipes, Sec. 10.9
It is important to start with the best possible values of wavenumber and
area ( using the cursor commands) and the line widths (scaled from
other regions if necessary) otherwise the minima are washed out and
harder to find.

Brief general notes on running ANNEAL  (example session later)

I usually start with
0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0  (if neither level is known)
10.0, 4, 0.4

and then when the plot has the right general shape switch to
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1.0, 4, 0.4
At this stage, you can try pulling the solution by pushing the starting
parameters in the desired direction, but that may not change anything
if there is a strong minimum.

The final run, to see if there is any small improvement left, is done
by setting the starting parameters quite close to the best so far, and
using
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0.4, 4, 0.4
