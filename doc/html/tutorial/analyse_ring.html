<H2> Dealing with Ringing</H2>
<P>
Xgremlin is able to make allowances for lines that are ringing due to
under-resolution of the lines. However, since the commands that enable
this to be done change the data significantly, they need careful study 
to understand how they work, and why they apparantly fit the line
rather badly!
<P>
To prevent findlines or linelist picking up the ringing on lines, a
filtered version exists which convolves the lines with a 2 or 4 point
Gaussian filter before finding the lines. To use this in linelist, type
<p>
<A HREF="../commands/linelist.html">
<b>linelist</b></A>  <em>wstart wstop</em> <b>10</b>
<p>
for a 2 point filter. 20 should be used instead of 10 for a 4 point
filter.
<P>
After making the lines active, they can be fitted with a
filtered version of lsqfit. This works best if you have the ringing
lines in the centre of the r array. First, set the filter using
<A HREF="../commands/lsqfit.html"><b>lsqfit filter</b></A> <em>nrise ncut</em>
<em>ncut</em> should be set to correspond to half the cutoff point
of the interferogram. The best way of determining this is to do a low
resolution transform of the data, using
<A HREF="../commands/fourtran.html">
 <b>fourtran</b></A>
plot it, and find the point number where the transform drops to near
zero. <em>nrise</em>, also in points, is included to drop the data
gradually to zero without sharp edges.
A value of <EM>ncut/2</EM> is suggested for a first
attempt. <A HREF="../commands/lsqfit.html"><b>lsqfit</b></A>
will then only fit the line over the range <em>ncut</em>, and hence
the data should be a closer representation of the actual line profile.
However it may not match so well the data you see on the plot.
<P>
An common way of dealing with ringing is to 
<A HREF="../commands/filter.html"> filter</A> the actual data
before doing any fitting. This is a good way of handling data that has
to be used in atlas, or in a similar situation where it is important
to see the main features without being distracted by ringing. However
it has the disadvantage of broadening the profile with the smoothing
function applied. A much better way of fitting the lines is to use a
