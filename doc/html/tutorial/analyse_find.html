<H2>Finding Lines</H2>
<P>
Now you have a real spectrum file with all of the continuum subtracted
away. The next thing you will probably want to do is to find out where
all the lines are over a certain discriminator. Which discriminator to
used depends on what you want to do and on what the spectrum looks
like. If you want to pick up as many lines as possible without getting
too many noise spikes, a good place to set the discriminator is at 5
times the noise level.
<P>
The best thing to do is to scale the whole spectrum such that the
noise level is equal to 1, so that the peak intensities will give the
signal-to-noise ratio. First, find the noise level, by plotting the
spectrum and placing two markers to deliminate a section that contains
noise and no lines. Then press &lt;Alt+a&gt; (bound to the button
'area' if you have the default button mappings). In the edit window
you will get output similar to the following:

<pre>
[21]:  
 Sum of r(i)       =  0.75096E+07
 Area              =  0.29417E+06 wavenumbers
 Mean of r         =   93870.
 RMS dev from mean =  0.16409E+06
 Centre of gravity =   94170.     points
                       24226.     wavenumbers
 Mean of range     =   24226.
</pre>
 
The noise level is given by the rms deviation from the mean. To scale
subsequent reads such that the noise level is 1, type
<A HREF="../commands/set.html">
<b>set scale</b></A> <em>1/noise</em>
You can enter this value into the appropriate space in the header
file, in which case it will be applied 
each time you open the spectrum to make it take effect.
<P>
To find all the lines, use the command  <A HREF="../commands/linelist.html">
<b>linelist</b></A> <em>discrim wstart wstop</em>.
This command needs all its parameters - just typing <b>linelist</b>
will not get you very far.
<b>linelist</b> finds all lines between <em>wstart</em> and
<em>wstop</em> with peak intensity greater than <em>discrim</em>
(<em>after</em> re-scaling with any factor you have set in the header
or with the <b>set scale</b> command). 
<p>
This creates the file <em>filename.lin</em> and stores the lines in
that file in binary format. If the file already exists, it makes a
copy of the old one in <EM>filename.lin.bak</EM> before creating the
new one. To get an ASCII listing, type
<A HREF="../commands/writelines.html">
<b>writelines </b> <em>filename wstart wstop</em></A>, where
<em>filename</em> is the name of the file for the listing.

<p>
This shows an <A HREF="analyse_writelines.html">
example of the <b>writelines</b> output</A>.

<P>
The command <b>writelines</b> <em>wstart wstop int</em>
only lists the lines between <em>wstart</em> and <em>wstop</em> over an
intensity <em>int</em>. If you lose or corrupt a .lin file, it is now
possible to read a file produced using writelines and use it to
produce another .lin file. The command is
<A HREF="../commands/readlines.html">
<b>readlines</b> <em>filename</em></A>. You can also close a .lin file
and re-open another .lin file by using the commands 
<A HREF="../commands/close.html"><b>close lineio</b></A>, followed by
<A HREF="../commands/open.html"><B>open lineio</B> <EM>filename</EM></A>.

<P>
Having found as many lines as possible, you should now go through the
spectrum and see what Xgremlin has found. It does not
always have the same idea as you as to what constitutes a line. To do
this, read in each buffer using 
<A HREF="../commands/read.html">
<b>read</b> <em>wstart</em></A>. If you have a reasonably small file,
you may be able to read in the whole of the file at once by setting
the size of the r array to the number of points using the 
<A HREF="../commands/alloc.html"><B>alloc</B></A> command.

<p>
You probably have only 3-4 points per line width, and you may wish to
interpolate a few more to give you a better idea of what the line
looks like. To do this, type 
<A HREF="../commands/stretch.html">
<b>stretch </b> <EM>n</EM></A>
where <EM>n</EM> is some power of 2 (2 is usually sufficient). 
This does a Fourier interpolation, and is equivalent to doing an
original FT of n-times the length, padding beyond the ends with
zeros. Then get the lines from the .lin file using
<A HREF="../commands/getlines.html"><b>getlines</b></A>
and <A HREF="../commands/plot.html"><b>plot</b></A>
them. 

<P>
If you wish to add lines, you must first set the width. You can
either set the width outside the plot routine with the command
<A HREF="../commands/set.html">
<b>set width</b> <em>width</em></A>
or inside the plot routine by telling Xgremlin to use the
width of the last line marked for all future lines. First display the
lines by pressing 
<A HREF="../plotmode.html">
<b>o</b></A>
and click with the left mouse button on a line with a suitable
width. The parameters of each line are listed at the bottom of the
screen. Then press <A HREF="../plotmode.html"> <b>&lt;Ctrl+s&gt;</b></a>
to set the width (ensure that you are in <em>plotmode</em>!). To
add a line, move the cursor until it is at the correct position, and press
<A HREF="../plotmode.html"><b>&lt;Ctrl+a&gt;</b></a>
To delete a line, click on it with the left mouse button and press
<A HREF="../plotmode.html"><b>&lt;Ctrl+d&gt;</b></a>

<P>
If you have un-resolved hyperfine or isotope structure it may be
better to save the centres of gravity of the lines. These should
correspond well to the unshifted energy levels, and experience has
shown that they can be reproducible to within a few mK. To save the
centre of gravity, first set markers on either side of the line
and then press
<A HREF="../plotmode.html"><b>&lt;Ctrl+g&gt;</b></a>.
This finds the centre of gravity, saves the parameters in the internal
linelist, and displays the parameters on the screen. You may either
delete the lines gremlin found (the individual hfs components), or
keep them if you wish to try and fit the structure of the line.

<P>
Once you have selected all the lines, remember to put them back on to the
.lin file with
<A HREF="../commands/putlines.html">
<b>putlines</b></A>
It is often a good idea to set up an alias, such as
<b>
<A HREF="../commands/alias.html">alias</A>
fitl &quot;getlines;plot;putlines&quot;</b>
so lines are automatically put back once you have found them. An
even better way is to bind the <b>putlines</b> command to one of the
buttons, between the plot and edit screens. This encourages you to save the
lines frequently (say every screenfull).
