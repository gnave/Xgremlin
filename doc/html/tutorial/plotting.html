<h1> Plotting in Xgremlin </h1>

The <a href="../tutorial/gremlin_figure.html">main Xgremlin window</a>, 
<a name="window"> consists </a> of an
<a href="../glossary.html">edit</a> window and a 
<a href="../glossary.html">plot</a> 
window. Keyboard input is usually sent to the edit window and
mouse clicks are sent to the plot window. However it is possible to
send keyboard input to the plot window as well by either pressing the
<em>tab</em> key or by clicking on the button <em>PlotMode</em> with the
left mouse button. The 
<a href="../tutorial/plotmode.html"><em>Plotmode</em></a> 
<a name="plotmode">button</a> changes colour from
grey to red when the plot window is accepting keyboard input. It is
however possible to send mouse input to the plot window even when the
plot window is not accepting keyboard input -- this is the most common
way to use Xgremlin and if you have bound your most common
commands to the configurable buttons (see next paragraph) you will
rarely use the <em>Plotmode</em> button. Commands in the
edit window can be recalled using the keyboard arrow keys and it is
also possible to type the first few letters of a command and recall a
previous occurrence with the arrow keys (somewhat like the 4dos
command editor).

<p>
Function buttons are activated by clicking with the left
mouse button. The buttons between the plot window and the edit window
are configurable with the 
<b><a href="../commands/button.html">button</a></b> 
command. It is convenient to place
several <b>button</b> commands in the 
<a href="../tutorial/startup_xgr.html"><em>.xgremlinrc</em></a> 
file which lives in your home directory. 

<p>
The cursor in Xgremlin always follows the mouse, 
and a running display of the position of it is given whenever it is in
the plot region. To save positions of the cursor for use in commands,
it is possible to place 
<a href="../glossary.html">markers</a> 
on the plot. When the mouse is near a marked line in the
<a href="../glossary.html">internal linelist</a>, 
the parameters of that line are displayed
instead of the mouse position. If a marker is placed when these
parameters are displayed, the marker will select that line for the 
next command issued to the plot window (e.g. placing a marker on a
line and selecting &lt;Ctrl+d&gt; to delete it).

<p>
Markers in the plot are of two types: red and blue. Red markers are
placed by clicking the left mouse button at the position required in
the plot. Blue markers are placed by clicking the middle mouse button
at the required position. To remove the last marker, click the right
mouse button (if your mouse only has one or two buttons, 
check your X server manual to see how to emulate a three button mouse).
Most of the time red markers are used, and this is what
is referred to any time the color of the marker is not specifically
mentioned. 

When a marker is placed the position of it is displayed in
wavenumbers and wavelengths below the main plot. Up to 30 markers may
be placed at one time, and many of the plot commands will work on
several markers at once. For example, to add three lines to the line
list, place three markers and either click on the 'add line' button,
or press &lt;Ctrl+A&gt;. If the command is entered from the keyboard, make
sure that it is sent to the plot window by clicking on the 
<em>Plotmode</em> button.
