<h2>Re-compiling and Installing Xgremlin from Scratch</h2>
<b>Ulf Griesmann, Oct 27, 1997</b><p>
<b>update: Gillian Nave, Feb 2015 (gnave@nist.gov)</b><p><br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This document details the steps involved in compiling a new version
of the FTS spectrum analysis program Xgremlin from the sources and 
the installation procedure. With time the installation procedure will 
(hopefully) be increasingly automated but at present some 
human intervention is required. However, some of the software 
(like compilers) need only be installed once.<p>

<hr>
<b>Note:</b><br> 
If you already have installed compilers and libraries as
described in <b>Step 0</b> you can immediately proceed with <b>Step
1</b>.  If you want to install a binary distribution (programs
precompiled and ready for installation) read the file
<a href="Howto-Install-Binaries.html"> Howto-Install-Binaries</a> 
first and then proceed with <b>Step 3</b>.<p>
<hr>

<h3>Step 0: Tools and libraries</h3>
If you already have installed the Fortran compiler <b>gfortran</b>, the
<b>GNU C</b> compiler (or another ANSI C compiler) and the <b>Athena
widget library</b> you can proceed to <b>Step
1</b> unless you wish to update any of the compilers or libraries. Note that 
many implementations of the 3d Athena widget library have bugs preventing their 
use. The default compilation option is now the old ugly widgets.
<b>There is no need to install or update any of the compilers or
libraries regularly!</b><p>

Xgremlin uses only freely available compilers and libraries.
No proprietary software of any kind is required in compiling Xgremlin.
The following tools,
compilers and libraries must be installed:<p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Cygwin/X (Windows only)</b>
<dd>Cygwin/X provides an X11 interface and other packages to enable Xgremlin to be run on any Windows machine. It is
available from:
<pre> x.cygwin.com </pre>
All of the compilers and libraries below are available in cygwin. A full installation is not
usually necessary, but make sure that you have included all of the packages needed for Xgremlin.
If you have installed cygwin, you can proceed to <b>Step 1.</b>
<p>

<dt><b>GNU make</b>
<dd>This is optional but if your make utility has problems with the 
Xgremlin makefiles you will have to install GNU make. 
<p>

<dt><b>Fortran compiler gfortran </b>
<dd>This compiler is available for most machines, including Windows/cygwin, Mac OSX, and Linux.
It is available from:
<pre> https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran </pre>
Follow the instructions that come with the package to install gfortran
on your computer.<p> 

<dt><b>GNU C compiler</b>
<dd>An ANSI C compiler is required for compiling Xgremlin. 
If you already have an ANSI C compiler you can use it, otherwise we
recommend that you install the GNU C compiler from the Free Software
Foundation. (GCC is installed by default on computers running Linux and is 
the default xtools compiler on OS X) 

<b>Version 2.6.3 or higher of GCC should be used for Xgremlin.</b><p>

<dt><b>Machine precision library MPAR</b>
<dd>This library contains functions which are required by MINPACK. It is usually 
not necessary to install it separately.
Go the the subdirectory ./libMPAR and compile the library with
<pre> make -r</pre>
then install it with
<pre> make install</pre><p>

<dt><b>Athena-3d widget library (optional)</b>
<dd>
<b> Note that this packages causes problems on many machines now. The 2-d widget normally has fewer problems </b>
<dd>The components of the user interface of Xgremlin such as Buttons,
Text editor etc. are contained in the 'Athena widget library'. 
The normal Athena widget library that is distributed together with
the X window system only provides simple, 2-dimensional widget. 
Xgremlin will work well with the 2d Athena widgets but it will
not look good.<p>

<dt><b>Ghostscript</b>
<dd>Xgremlin can render the content of its plotting window as a color
Postscript file. If your site has no access to a Postscript printer
you can print these files on any printer using the freely 
available Postscript interpreter <b>Ghostscript</b>. 


This was the hard part, now comes the fun!<p>
<hr>

<h3>Step 1: Compiling Xgremlin</h3>
The source distribution is contained in a file called
<pre> xgremlin-x.xx.tar.gz </pre>
where x.xx is the version number e.g.: xgremlin-2.37.tar.gz
Uncompress the file with GNU 'gzip' and unpack it as follows:
<pre>
    gzip -d xgremlin-x.xx.tar.gz
    tar xvf xgremlin-x.xx.tar
</pre>
(<b>Note:</b> these two commands may be combined using a pipe:
<pre>
    gzip -dc xgremlin-<number>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre>
Don't forget the trailing '-' ! ).<p>

This will create a subdirectory 'xgremlin-x.xx' containing all
source files. Go to the new directory  xgremlin-x.xx  
and type in the command
<pre>
    ./Configure
</pre>
You will be asked a few questions mostly about library locations.
Then type
<pre>
    make machine-type
</pre>
where <kbd>machine-type</kbd> is the type of your computer. <kbd>machine-type</kbd>
must be one of the following (at present):
<dl>
<dt> <b>sunos4-sparc</b>
<dd> SunOS 4.1.x running on Sparc processors 
<dt> <b>solaris2-sparc</b> 
<dd> Solaris 2.x running on Sparc processors
<dt> <b>aix3-rs6000</b> 
<dd> AIX 3.x running on IBM RS/6000 Power processors
<dt> <b>linux-i386</b>
<dd> Linux running on Intel x86, Pentium etc. processors
<dt> <b>linux-axp</b>
<dd> Linux on DEC Alpha processors
<dt> <b>macosx</b>
<dd> OS X on Macintosh computers.
<dt> <b>cygwin</b>
<dd> Under cygwin on Windows machines.
</dl>

By default it is assumed that you use GCC for compiling the program.<p>

<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
    make macosx
</pre>
will in one swoop compile the whole Xgremlin program 
for you on your Macintosh computer. 
<p>
<hr>

<h3>Step 2: Installing Xgremlin</h3>
If all the programs have been created successfully, 
type
<pre>
    sudo make install
</pre>
and type the superuser password. This will install the programs in the directory /usr/local/bin.<p>

If this is the first time you install Xgremlin you will have to install 
a few auxiliary files in the directory /usr/local/xgremlin . 
This is done automatically with the command
<pre>
    make install-drivers install-doc
</pre>
while still being superuser. This step completes the installation.<p>

If you wish to keep the source code around you can save some disk
space by typing
<pre>
    make clean
</pre>
which will remove object files and object libraries in all 
subdirectories.<p>
<hr>

<h3>Step 3: Configuring Xgremlin</h3>
Before Xgremlin can be used a few things need to be configured:
<b>If you have already configured the printer and configuration files
previously you can skip this step.</b><p>

<b>The most important configuration file</b> is the application defaults
database 'Xgremlin' which is found in the directory './configurations'
The location of the application default files varies with the computer, with the default being:
<pre>
    /usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults
</pre>
Other places to look for the app-defauls directory are:
<pre>
    /opt/X11/share/X11/app-defaults
</pre>

The application defaults file will be copied to this directory when
the 'make install' command is issued but you should make sure that
it was really installed correctly. A binary distribution also installs
this file to its correct location automatically.<p>

<b>If the application defaults file is not installed correctly the
program will not work.</b> Should you get a pile of buttons and
windows instead of a nicely laid out application then you know that
the application defaults file is not in its proper place.<p>

Any startup commands that are to be executed by every user when 
the program is started should be included in the system wide
initialization file 
<pre>
    /usr/local/xgremlin/xgremlin.conf .
</pre>
Every user should have their own initialization file named
<pre>
    .xgremlinrc        ( don't forget the dot ! )
</pre>
in the home directory which is run after the
system wide initialization file when Xgremlin is started.
(This would be the place to configure your buttons).<p>


<b>Printing and screen dumps</b><br>
An important part of configuration is the printer configuration which 
enables hardcopies of the plotter window. Xgremlin uses the 'standard'
(BSD-) Unix command 'lpr' for printing the screen dump. By default the
printer name in Xgremlin is set to 'none' which means that screen dumps
are created but not printed. The 'printer' command must be used 
(e.g. in a startup file) to define the printer/queue Xgremlin should use.<p>


<b>Printing with Ghostscript</b><br>
For those without access to a Postscript printer all is not lost because there
is Ghostscript, a program that will turn any tired printer into a fully
featured Postscript printer. <p>


<b>Sample spectra</b><br>
Xgremlin comes with a sample solar spectrum 'solar_spectrum.run' 
(provided by Mark Abrams) in the directory ./doc This spectrum could 
be copied to /usr/local/xgremlin to give users a sample file to play 
with that is guaranteed to work. The sample solar spectrum can be
loaded into Xgremlin with the command 'run solar_spectrum.run'.<p>

This completes configuration of Xgremlin.<p>
<hr>

<h3>Step 4: Running Xgremlin</h3>
Xgremlin is started with the command
<pre>
    xgremlin &
</pre>
It is usually most convenient to run
<b>xgremlin</b> as a <b>background process</b>.<p>

<b>Getting help</b><br>
The Xgremlin help system is invoked by clicking on the <b>Documentation</b>
menu entry in the <b>Gremlins</b> menu.
The directory ./doc of the source distribution
contains a file 'plot-mode-chart.ps' which is a wall chart with the plot 
mode commands of Xgremlin. The man pages can be viewed with
<pre>
man xgremlin
man dumplin
man mergelin
</pre>

<b>Memory requirements</b><br>
The memory requirements of Xgremlin depend on the size of the dynamic
arrays that are being used. After program startup Xgremlin requires
only approximately 4MB of memory because the default size for the
internal arrays is small.<p>
