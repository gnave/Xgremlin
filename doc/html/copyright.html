The program <b>Xgremlin</b> is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful, but <b>without any explicit or implied warranty</b>.<p>
 
<b>Xgremlin</b> is cobbled together from programs and libraries by
various authors. Different parts of the program therefore carry
different copyrights:

<ol>

<li><b>James W. Brault</b> (then at the National Solar Observatory,
Tuscon) and <b>Mark C. Abrams</b> wrote the original MS-DOS program
<b>Gremlin</b> upon which Xgremlin is based.  Most of the Fortran
source code for <b>libgremlin.a</b> is derived form the original
program. The <b>Gremlin</b> program is in the <b>Public Domain</b>.<p>

<li>The parts of Xgremlin written by <b>Ulf Griesmann</b> (not in
connection with work payed for by N.I.S.T.) are under the <b>GNU
General Public License</b>. In essence, this means that Xgremlin or
parts of the program can not become a proprietary program.<p>

<li>The copyright on the regular expression library that is used in
Xgremlin is held by <b>Tatu Ylonen, Espoo, Finland</b>. The reguar
expression library can be used free of charge for any purpose.<p>

<li>The copyright on the <b>MINPACK version 1</b> least squares
fitting subprograms are held by the <b>Argonne National Laboratory,
U.S.A.</b>. The source code of the MINPACK package is in the <b>public
domain</b>.<p>

<li>The copyright for the <b>Display Widget</b> is held by <b>Sundar
Narasimhan</b> and the <b>MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,
Cambridge, MA 02139 USA</b>.<p>

<li>Computer Generations, Inc. is holder of the copyright for the LiteClue
widget which is the basis of the bubble help system for the top row of buttons. 
The widget is freeware: it can be used free of charge and it is free of any warranty.<p>

<li>Xgremlin contains functions for sorting of arrays and a random
number generator. These functions were obtained from the <b>NIST Guide
to Available Mathematical Software (GAMS)</b> (see
http://www.nist.gov). GAMS programs are in the <b>Public
Domain</b>.<p>

<li>The subroutines for Singular Value Decomposition and related subroutines
are taken from the <b>SLATEC</b> and <b>BLAS</b> libraries. SLATEC and BLAS
are in the <b>Public Domain</b>.<p>

<li>The copyright for the <b>hyperfine structure fitting</b> routines is held by Bruce Pulliam.<p>

<li><b>Gillian Nave</b> is the author of the Gremlin tutorial and the Xgremlin 
tutorial in HTML format and the interface for the hyperfine structure fitting package. The tutorials are in the <b>Public Domain</b>.<p>
