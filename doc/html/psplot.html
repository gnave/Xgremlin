<title>psplot: A program to create atlas plots from Xgremlin</title>
</head>

psplot  is  used  to  create  spetral atlas plots in conjunction with the 
<a href="atlas.html">atlas</a>
command in Xgremlin. The documentation for psplot is minimal, but some example files are included in the distribution in the hope that they will be somewhat useful.
<p>
The file that the atlas command creates in Xgremlin has the default name <b>atlas.data</b>. An example atlas.data file is included in the psplot directory, taken from the solar_spectrum.run file in the doc directory. The atlas.data file was created from the solar spectrum example using the following commands in Xgremlin:
<pre>
run solar_spectrum.run
atlas scale 0. 1000.
atlas label "Example solar spectrum"
atlas 9000. 26000. 10.
</pre>

The <a href="atlas.html">atlas</a> command is reasonably well documented, unlike psplot itself. psplot in turn creates the file <b> psplot.ps</b> in Postscript format. 
<p>
When psplot is started it first reads commands  from  a  local  configuration file <b>psplot.init</b> in  the current directory. The name of the configuration file may be changed with the -i command line option. If this is not present, it gives the error message 'No local init file'. The example file <b>plot.ini</b> contains the psplot commands required to create the double pane atlas plot in the file <b>psplot.ps</b>.  
<p>
The commands in the plot.ini file are as follows:
<pre>
screen "Standard KPNO atlas pages, loop until out of data"
option ps
scale 0.95 1.00

location 200 3200 1340 2380  
ticksize 1. 1. 5. 10. 50. 100.

screen "Draw the three horizontal dividing lines"

location 200 3200 172 1212   
ticksize 1. 1. 5. 10. 50. 100.

screen "Title line below"
justify right; relocate 3260 113;putlabel  "cm^{-1}"

putlabel "Example solar spectrum"

This file is reasonably easy to modify to get an atlas plot for any other data that you might want. The only other documentation is in the source code itself, although there may be some in Mark Abrams thesis.
