<h2>dumplin - dump and analyze (X)Gremlin line list files</h2><p>

<b>Syntax:</b> <kbd>dumplin</kbd> <i> &lt .lin files &gt [-tsh] </i><p>

<b>dumplin</b> is a small utility which may be used to display the
header portion of a binary Gremlin line list (.lin) file, to dump the
data in a line list file in text format and to trim trailing invalid
line records from the line list file. It is a convenient way to "peek"
at the contents of a .lin file without having to start up Xgremlin and
load spectrum and .lin file.<p>

Without any command options the contents of the line list file will be
written to an ASCII file which gets the file extension .lin.lst 
The following options are available in <b>dumplin</b>:

<dl>
<dt> <b>-h</b>
<dd> print out the header section of a line list file (number of lines and 
data in the file).<p>

<dt> <b>-s</b>
<dd> write the line list in text format to 
<b>stdout</b> ( standard output ) and not to a file.<p>

<dt> <b>-t</b>
<dd> the actual size of a line list file increases whenever line records are
added to the file but as a consequence of the way line list files are
handled by
Xgremlin
it does not shrink when line records are removed. When many lines are
removed from a linelist (e.g. after a 
<a href="commands/linelist.html">linelist</a>
command with a small discriminator) many invalid line records can accumulate
at the end of a line list file. The <b>-t</b> option may be used to remove these
already deleted line records. Also, if line records are out of order in 
a line list file (for whatever reason) the <b>-t</b> option will return them to
ascending wavenumber order.

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<dl>
<dt> <kbd>dumplin -h *.lin</kbd>
<dd> will display the header sections of all .lin files in the current directory.
<p>
<dt> <kbd>dumplin mydata</kbd>
<dd> will dump the line list data records in the file
<b>mydata.lin</b> in ASCII. A file <b>mydata.lin.lst</b> will be
created.
</dl>
