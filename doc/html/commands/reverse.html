<H2>reverse</H2>
<H3>Syntax:</H3>
reverse  (no arguments)
<p>
Reverse the data in the 'r' array.  Reset wref and delw to correspond
to the reversed data.
<p> 
This command is most often used when dealing with even order aliases,
where the spectrum has been obtained from the interferogram using the
command <a href="fourtran.html"> fourtran</a>. In this case, remember
to reset the length to half the number of points that you read in, as 
the 'fourtran' command leaves the spectrum in the lower part of the
'r' array only.

It could also in principle be used for plotting spectra in increasing
wavelength, rather than wavenumber, but in this case the command <a
href="interpolate.html">interpolate</a> is more useful, as it changes
the scale such that the points are evenly spaced in wavelength, rather
than wavenumber.

<H3>Example:</H3>
The following commands will open an interferogram, read in the central
section, transform it, reverse the spectrum and plot the result.
<pre>
open datain &lt;filename&gt;
set centerread
read &lt;wref&gt; 65536
