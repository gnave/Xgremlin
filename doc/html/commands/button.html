<h2>button</h2>
<p>
<b>Syntax:</b>
<ul>
<li> button <i>&lt number &gt</i> edit <i> &lt "button label" &gt &lt 
     "command string" &gt </i>
<li> button <i>&lt number &gt</i> plot <i> &lt "button label" &gt &lt 
     "plot command" &gt </i>
</ul>

The button command is used to assign a command to one of the buttons
between the ploting and editing window. Buttons are numbered from 
1 to 8 (left to right). There are two types of commands: <b>edit commands</b>
are those that would normally be typed in at the prompt in the text
window of Xgremlin (e.g. <a href = "dispar.html">dispar</a>). 
To assign an edit command to a button
the following form of the button command must be used:<p>

button <i>&lt number &gt</i> edit <i> &lt "button label" &gt &lt 
     "command string" &gt </i><p>

<b>Example:</b> button 1 edit sinc "sinc 10. 500;plot"<p>
	
will label the leftmost button <a href = "sinc.html">sinc</a> and
assign the command 'sinc 10. 500;plot' to the button (calculate a sinc
function in the r-array and plot the result on the screen). (It is
also possible to assign some useful command to a button.)<p>
	
For <b>plot commands</b> the command has the same form as described in
help topic <a href = "../plotmode.html">Plot mode commands</a>:<br>
<b> &lt modifier &gt + &lt key &gt </b> <p>

<b>Example 1:</b> button 2 plot Zoom-in x <p>
	
This labels the 2nd button from the left with 'Zoom-in' and assigns
to it the command 'x' which lets you zoom in at the center of the plot
(or at a set marker). None of the keys <shift> <control> <meta> (or <alt>)
is pressed.<p>

<b>Example 2:</b> button 4 plot Zoom-out M+x <p>

assigns the plot command &lt meta &gt -x (or &lt alt &gt -x on a PC) used 
for zooming out to button number 4.<p>

<b>Note:</b><br>
Following the usual Xgremlin conventions, strings containing blank spaces 
such as in "sinc 10. 500" must be enclosed in quotes so they are 
recognised as a single string by Xgremlin.<p>

For a list of plot commands see help topic <a href =
