This command performs a least squares fit to either absorption
or emission data in the current buffer using Voigt profiles.
Lines must be <a href="active.html">active</a> (i.e. subtracted from the data to produce
a set of residuals) before they can be refined using the
<b>lsqfit</b> command.<p>

Lines which show appreciable ringing need a "filtered fit", in which
the residuals are filtered back to the cutoff set by the original
interferogram between each iteration; this process is invoked by the
lsqfit filter version, which sets up the parameters but does not do
any actual fitting. ncut specifies the cutoff point for filtering, and
should be determined in the same way as for <a
href="filter.html">filter</a>. If <b>ncut</b> is absent, it is
calculated from parameters in the header file, using the number of
points in the interferogram, the position of the central fringe and
the apodization used.  If the latter is identically zero, it is
assumed to be the canonical 10% . nrise is the width in points of the
cosine bell function applied to the ends of the data before it is
transformed for filtering. This is to prevent end effects, and values
of nop/10 (usually 400) are normally sufficient (see mask for
details). If a valid .hdr file does not exist (e.g., the data came in
through readcards, not datain), then both nrise and ncut must be
specified.<p>

A filtered lsqfit is preferable to filtering the data and then
executing <b>lsqfit</b> as filtering changes the width and intensity of
the line, whereas a filtered lsqfit will resemble the original
line more closely, as if it had not been under-resolved. Hence
the profile from a filtered lsqfit may well be sharper than the
observed data, as this observed data will have been broadened by
the instrument function of the interferometer.<p>

<b>Note:</b><br> A detailed discussion of line <a
href="../tutorial/analyse_find.html">finding</a> and <a
href="../tutorial/analyse_fit.html">fitting</a> lines is given in the
<b>Xgremlin tutorial</b>. The tutorial also contains a section on
<a href="../tutorial/filtering.html">filtering and fitting</a> lines.
