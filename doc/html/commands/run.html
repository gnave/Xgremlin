<H2>run</H2>
<H3>Syntax:</H3>
run [ <em>&lt;filename&gt; </em>]
<p>
	If a filename is given, unit "com" is closed (if necessary) and
	re-connected to filename; further command input will come from
	this file.  If no name is given, it is assumed that a file has 
	already been previously connected to "com", and the next command
	will come from the current position of that file.
<p>
	NOTE:
	This command directs that input should be taken from the
	previously connected file instead of from the keyboard;
	it must therefore be the last command on a line.

<H3>Example:</H3>
<pre>
run plotsinc
</pre>
where the file 'plotsinc' contains the commands:
<pre>
sinc 10. 1024
plot
</pre>
will open the file 'plotsinc' as the 'com' unit and run all the commands in it: i.e. make
a sinc function and plot it
