<h3> Introduction</h3>
      This command is used to fit hyperfine structure patterns to lines. The
      program currently fits up to three hyperfine structure patterns
      at once, and most of the commands are available in the hyperfine 
      structure window under the <b> gremlins </b> button, which is
      just a front-end for all the commands described here. <p>

      In fitting a hyperfine structure pattern, the first thing needed
      (apart from the spectrum) is a file containing the energy level
      information. The first line contains only the nuclear angular
      momentum <b>I</b>. Subsequent lines have 7 columns: 
      <ol>
	<li> Energy level name (containing no spaces)
	<li> J value of energy level
	<li> Energy level value in cm-1
	<li> Parity - 0 for odd, 1 for even
	<li> lifetime of level - use a '-' if none available
	<li> A value - use 0 if not measured
	<li> B value - use 0 if not measured
      </ol>
      The exact format of the columns does not matter, but there
      must not be any spaces in the energy level name, and all
      columns must contain something.
<p>
Here is an example (for Ho I): 
<pre>
3.5
     0______7   7.5         0.0000         0    -    26.7 -55.6 
     5419___6   6.5      5419.7000         0    -    31.4 -41.0
     8605___5   5.5      8605.1600         0    -    0 0

     16735__6   6.5     16735.9500         1    -    29.48 6.4
     16882__7   7.5     16882.2800         1  2720.  15.97 -13.5
</pre>


<h3>The hfs window</h3>

    The level file is opened by opening the <a href="hfs_win.gif"> hfs
    window</a> (under the <b>gremlins</b> button), filling in the
    filename in the <i>Level file</i> field, and clicking on the
    <b>read</b> button next to the </i>level file</i> field. If you
    have a previously saved hfs line file (see below), you can read it
    in by filling its nane in the <i>Line file</i> field and clicking
    on the <b>read</b> button next to that field.<p>
      
      After reading in the energy level information, you can start to
      fit the lines. First, read in the spectrum, plot it, and expand
      the plot so that the line you want to fit is roughly in the center
      of the plot. Insert the <b>Ritz</b> wavenumber of the line in the
      <i> Wavenumber</i> field. The <b>Ritz</b> wavenumber <b>must</b>
      be the difference of two energy levels in the levels file. Then
      insert an approximate peak intensity for the stongest hyperfine
      component in the <i>Intensity</i> field, and click on the
      <b>insert</b> button. Provided the wavenumber is indeed the
      difference between two energy levels in the level file, the
      program will fill in all the other fields.<p>
      
      Next, you can fill in or change any of the information about the
      level, such as the A or B values, the width (full width at half
      maximum for each component), damping (Kielkopf's eta parameter -
      not the one used elsewhere in Xgremlin), wavenumber, intensity,
      etc. Click on the <b>update</b> button to make these changes
      take effect ( this is also done by the <b>plot</b> and
      <b>fit</b> buttons). <a href="hfs_plot.gif">Plot</a> the result
      by clicking on the <b>plot</b> button. The <a
      href="hfs_comp.gif"><b>components</b></a> button plots the
      individual hyperfine components.<p>

      Before fitting the line, you may want to fix the value of
      certain parameters (such as the lower A and B value, if they
      were previously measured). Do this by clicking on the
      <b>hold</b> button next to the parameter you want fixed. The
      button will change color, to signify that the quantity will not
      be changed during fitting. Fit the line by clicking on the
      <b>fit</b> button. The program writes out some fit information
      in the main edit window of Xgremlin, and also saves it in a file
      <i>Phits_FitData </i>. <p>

      The program can store the line in both binary and ASCII formats.
      The binary format can be read back in by the program, and is
      similar to the .lin file for the fitting of Voigt profiles. You
      can save the lines to this file by filling in the name on the
      <i>Line file</i> field at the bottom of the window, and clicking 
      on the <b>save</b> button. Do the same with the <a href="hfs_asc.txt"><i>ASCII
	file</i></a> field to get a file readable by humans.<p>

<h3> The hfs commands</h3>

Almost all of the commands can be accessed through the hfs
    window, which is simply a front-end for the following
    commands. However they can also be typed into the main Xgremlin
    edit window. Usually, the only ones you are likely to want to type
    in are <kbd> hfs disp</kbd>, and <kbd>hfs level</kbd>. However here
    is a list of all the commands, together with what they do. 

<dl>

<dt> <kbd>hfs close hfslev <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></kbd> 
<dd>Closes levels file called <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>

<dt> <kbd>hfs close hfsline  <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> </kbd>
<dd>Closes lines file called <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>

<dt> <kbd> hfs delete &lt;linnum&gt; </kbd>
<dd>     Deletes a line from linelist

<dt><kbd> hfs disp &lt;line1&gt [&lt;line2&gt; ]  </kbd>
<dd> prints out parameters of lines between line1 and line2

<dt><kbd>hfs fit &lt;line1&gt [&lt;line2&gt; &lt;line3&gt;] [&lt;fit_window&gt;]</kbd>
<dd> Fits the line listed. Currently up to three overlapping hyperfine 
	patterns can be fitted. The lines are fitted up to 5 half
	widths each side of the shortest and longest wavenumber
	component of the line. This can be changed by appending the
	<i>fit_window</i>, which is a floating point number
	corresponding to how far away in cm-1 from each component the
	fit should extend (e.g. a fit window of 0.5 will fit the
	lines from 0.5 cm-1 before the first component to 0.5 cm-1
	beyond the last component.<p> 

	The <i>fit_window</i> is not available in the hfs window.<p>
	  
	  Make sure that the lines are close together in wavenumber
	  before you fit them. The program will fit
	  the whole region between the lines, and hence it may take a
	  very long time if the lines are widely separated.

<dt><kbd> hfs get </kbd>
<dd> Reads the linelist from the binary file previously opened with
	<kbd>hfs open hfsline <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> </kbd> into memory.

<dt><kbd>  hfs hold <line> <parameter>    </kbd>  
<dd>  Holds the parameter for the line at current value, so they will
	not be changed in the fit. Valid parameters are:
<ul>
<li> al - the lower energy level A value
<li> au - the upper energy level A value
<li> bl - the lower energy level B value
<li> bu - the upper energy level B value
<li> waveno - the line wavenumber
<li> snr - the signal-to-noise ratio of the strongest component of the 
	    line.
<li> damp - the Kielkopf damping parameter of the line
<li> fwhm - the full width at half maximum of the line.
</ul>
To allow these parameters to be fitted, use <kbd>hfs release</kbd>

<dt><kbd> hfs insert &lt;wavenumber&gt; &lt;inten&gt;      </kbd>  
<dd>  Inserts a line at wavenumber into linelist. If the line
	wavenumber corresponds <b>exactly</b> to a difference between
	two energy levels in a previously read energy level file, the
	J-value, A-value and B-value of the two energy levels is also
	filled in. 

<dt><kbd>  hfs level &lt;lev_value&gt; </kbd>  
<dd>  lists all predicted lines involving one level.

<dt><kbd>  hfs open hfslev &lt;fname&gt;
 </kbd>  
<dd>   Opens the ASCII level file &lt;fname&gt; and read in levels. 
            
       The format of levels file is:
<ul>
<li>          1st line : nuclear spin
<li>          subsequent lines:
          up to 32 chars of level id, with no spaces ; j value; energy
          level value ; parity - 0 for odd and 1 for even ; lifetime;
	  A-coeff; B-coeff.
</ul>

<dt><kbd> hfs open hfsline &lt;fname&gt;   </kbd>  
<dd>  Opens the binary hfs line file &lt;fname&gt;.

<dt><kbd> hfs plot &lt;line1&gt; [&lt;line2&gt; &lt;line3&gt; ....]
	</kbd><br>
<kbd> hfs plot &lt;line1&gt; [&lt;line2&gt; &lt;line3&gt; ....] comp </kbd><br>
<kbd> hfs plot &lt;line1&gt; [&lt;line2&gt; &lt;line3&gt; ....] save &lt;datafile&gt; </kbd>
<dd> Plot the line or lines listed. Currently up to three lines can be 
	plotted simultaneously. <p>

	Make sure that all the lines are
	visible in the plot, as the program will attempt to plot the
	lines regardless of whether you can see them. This may take a
	long time if the lines are widely separated in wavenumber.<p>
	  
     The second version plots all the components of the line as well
	  as the total fit. This takes some time, so is not
	  recommended for general use.<p>

     The third version saves the fit to the file &lt;datafile&gt;

<dt><kbd> hfs release &lt;line&gt; &lt;parameter&gt;    </kbd>
<dd> This is the opposite of <kbd>hfs hold</kbd> - it releases
	parameters so they can be fitted. Valid parameter values are
	the same as <kbd>hfs hold</kbd>.

<dt><kbd> hfs save  </kbd>
<dd>  Saves the whole linelist to the file previously opened with
	<kbd> hfs open hfsline &lt;filename&gt;</kbd>.

<dt><kbd> hfs set &lt;linnum&gt; &lt;parameter&gt; &lt;value&gt; </kbd>
<dt><kbd> hfs set interp &lt;integer&gt; </kbd>
<dd>  Sets &lt;parameter&gt; to &lt;value&gt; for the specified line,
	and releases it so it can be fitted. 

<ul>
<li>el  The lower energy level. This also sets the J value of the level
<li>eu  The upper energy level. This also sets the J value of the level
<li>al  The lower A value
<li>bl  The lower B value
<li>au  The upper A value
<li>bu  The upper B value
<li>waveno The wavenumber of the line
<li>snr  The signal-to-noise ratio of the strongest component of the line.
<li>damp The Kielkopf damping parameter.
<li>fwhm The full width at half maximum.
<li>comment A comment on the fit - up to 40 characters long.
<li>interp An interpolation parameter for the fit (only). This
	    interpolates points in the fit to give a smoother
	    profile. The original data is not changed. A value of 4
	    will give smooth Voigt profiles with data that are
	    minimally sampled.
</ul>

<dt><kbd> hfs write &lt;fname&gt;  </kbd>
<dd>  Writes the whole hfs linelist to the ascii file
	&lt;fname&gt;. The file must not exist beforehand.

<h3>Examples</h3>

The following example opens a spectrum file "ho0903.002_c", reads in
    levels from the file "ho_i.lev", reads in some lines from the
    binary file "ho.hfslin", and displays the first 3 lines. It then
    inserts a line at the wavenumber 16554.55, with intensity 230. The 
    line is inserted in position 140, and the example then
    fits this line, and plots the result. 

<pre>
  open datain ho0903.002_c
  hfs open hfslev ho_i.lev
  hfs open hfsline ho.hfslin
  hfs get
  hfs close hfsline
  hfs disp 1 3
  hfs set interp 4
  read
  cmplx real
  plot
  hfs insert 16554.55 230.  
  hfs fit 140 
  hfs plot 140
