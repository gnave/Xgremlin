<b>Syntax: </b>response <i> &lt filename &gt [ &lt spline tension factor &gt ]
&lt'photon' or 'intensity'&gt</i>
<p>

This command recovers the combined response function of an optical
system (filters transmission, spectrometer transmissionand detector
quantum efficiency) from the measured spectrum of a standard lamp and
the known spectral radiance data for the standard lamp. The measured
spectrum of the standard lamp must be in the <b>r</b> array before the
<b>response</b> command is run. When the command is completed the lamp
spectrum in <b>r</b> will be replaced by the optical response
function; the <b>tr</b> array will contain the interpolated lamp
calibration spectrum for inspection. (It is accessible via the <a
href="exchange.html">exchange </a> command.) The response function is
always normalized to a peak value of 1. Once obtained it may be used
directly in e.g. a <a href = "writelines.html"> writelines </a>
command for calibration of spectral line intensities.
<p>

When the command parameter <b>photon</b> is specified with the
<b>response</b> command, the resulting response curve will be weighted
with the wavenumber.  This has the effect that the intensities in the
output of a subsequent <a href = "writelines.html"> writelines </a>
command are proportional to the photon flux which is desirable for
branching ratio work because branching ratios are ratios of transition
probabilities. When the command parameter <b>intensity</b> is
specified, no weighting with wavenumbers takes place and the
intensities in the output of <a href =
"writelines.html">writelines</a> will be true spectral intensities
(proportional to <i>Watts</i>). <b>The intensity calibration of a
spectrum is carried out in the <a href="writelines.html"> 
writelines</a> command in which the equivalent width of 
the lines is divided by the value of the response curve at 
the wavenumbers of the spectral lines.</b>
 <p>

The parameters for the <b>response</b> command are:<br><br>

<b>filename</b> 
(a character string)<br> This is the file name of the
calibration data of the standard lamp. The file must be a 2 - column
ASCII file with <b>wavelengths</b> in the first column and radiances
in the second column. If the <b>vuv flag</b> (see the <a href="info.html"> 
info </a> command) is set the wavelengths in the spectral radiance file must
be vacuum wavelengths, otherwise they are air wavelengths.
xgremlin searches for the calibration file
first in the director /usr/local/xgremlin, then in the current
directory (see <a href="pwd.html">pwd</a>).  Comment lines may begin
with either one of the following characters: ; # !  Spectral radiances
(usual symbol: L) <b>must</b> be in the following units: 
<pre>

                            W
         [L]  =    -------------------
                         2     
                       cm    nm  sr
</pre>
i.e. radiance / <b>unit wavelenth in nm</b>. Note that for historical 
reasons, to confuse the unwary, and because it yields radiance data with
convenient magnitude, spectral radiances are often given 
in the units
<pre>

                     W
         [L]' =    -------
                     3     
                   cm  sr
</pre>
in other words, the wavelength is measured in <b>cm</b>.
Obviously, [L]' can easily  be converted into [L]:
<pre>
                  -7
         [L]' = 10   [L]
</pre>
For the purpose of the <b>response</b> command one set of units is as
good as the other since the response function is normalized to a peak
value of 1 anyway.  A typical spectral radiance calibration file may
look like this:
<p>
<pre>
#
# NIST tungsten strip standard lamp Q76 
# re-measured spectral radiance of June 13, 1988
#
#  wavelength / nm          spectral radiance / W cm-3 sr-1
   250.0                    44.087
   260.0                    82.57
   280.0                    245.95
   300.0                    612.57
   350.0                    3422.9
   400.0                    11166.0
   500.0                    47638.0
   600.0                    104335.0
   654.6                    135815.0
</pre>
<p>

<b>spline tension factor</b> (a floating point number)<br>
This parameter is <b>optional</b> and should hardly ever be needed. 
A spline function under tension is
used to interpolate the spectral radiance data. The default tension factor is 0.0 
(i.e. no tension). A larger tension factor leads to a 'stiffer' spline function 
which can be used to achieve some degree of smoothing of the radiance data.
<p>

<b>photon or intensity (mandatory)</b><br>
Specifies the type of response function and determines if the output
of a subsequent <a href = "writelines.html">writelines</a> command is proportional 
to photon flux or true intensity.
<p>


<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>
The intensity calibration of a line spectrum typically requires
the following steps:

<ol>
<li>generate a line list file (.lin) in the way described elsewhere.<p>

<li> read the standard lamp spectrum into the <b>r</b> array and prepare
it for the recovery of the response function if necessary. This
may involve filtering the spectrum with a 
<a href = "filter.html"> filter </a> command to simulate a lower resolution
if the standard lamp spectrum is not free of line structure (can
happen with deuterium lamps and argon miniarcs) or to remove excessive noise
from the lamp spectrum.<p>
<li>recover the response function:
<pre>
   response  d2_lamp_radiance.dat photon
</pre>
This command will read radiance data from the file
<b>d2_lamp_radiance.dat</b> and create the response curve in the <b>r</b> 
array. <p>
<li>The resulting response function can then be used in a
<a href = "writelines.html"> writelines </a> command for intensity 
calibration of lines in a line list. The output is already weighted
for the calculation of branching ratios.
</ol>
