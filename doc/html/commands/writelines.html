<h3>Syntax: </h3> writelines <em> &lt;filename&gt;  [ &lt;wstart&gt;
&lt;wstop&gt; ]  [ &lt;smin&gt; ]  [ &lt;smax&gt; ]  [intcorr] [aircorr] [wavcorr]</em> 

<p>
where
<ul>
<li>	wstart - first wavenumber wanted
<li>	wstop  - last wavenumber wanted
	(Default is all lines in the file)
<li>	smin - minimum line strength written to file
<li>	smax - maximum line strength written to file
</ul>

Writelines reads the line parameters from the .lin file attached 
to unit <b>lineio</b> in the desired range and writes them out to file
"filename" as an ASCII file.  This file may be sent to the terminal
instead by simply using  "con" as the filename.
<p>
If an upper limit (smax) is wanted, all four parameters must be given.
<p>
If intensity correction is wanted have the (lo-res) response function
of the optical system in r and add the command parameter <b>intcorr</b>.
See the description of the 'response' command for a way to
obtain the response function. if the response function is zero, lines at
these wavenumbers are not written out to the linelist file.
<p>
If the command parameter <b>aircorr</b> is added on the command line the
wavenumbers in the line list are corrected for the refractive index of air
(Birch and Downs formulae). <b>The air correction is not applied by default.</b>
Pressure and temperature parameters for the air correction are taken from the file header.
<p> 
The command parameter <b>wavcorr</b> requests that the linear wave number correction
is applied to the wavenumbers in the line list. <b>The wavenumber correction is
not applied by default.</b>
<p> 
The held parameters (H) are coded as follows:
<ul>
<li>		1 = damping
<li>		2 = width
<li>		4 = sigma
<li>		8 = amplitude
</ul>
If more than one parameter is held, H = the sum of the individual
values.

System tags (4th tag character) have the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>		I = line was manually inserted
<li>		F = line came from a derivative findlines or lineseek
<li>		L = line has been through lsqfit
<li>		R = line has been through a filter lsqfit ("ringfit")
</ul>

A description of the output format can be found in the Xgremlin
tutorial in the section on
<a href="../tutorial/analyse_find.html">
finding and fitting lines</a>.

<h3>  Example:</h3>
<pre>
writelines neon.data intcorr
</pre>
will read line data records from the line list file
that is currently attached to the 'lineio' unit and write
the line list data to the ASCII file "neon.data" after
after dividing intensities by the optical response function
in the 'r' array.
