<b>Syntax: </b>background <kbd>&lt;nbin &gt; &lt;threshold &gt;
           ["subtract" | "onlysubtract"] ["median" | "average"]</kbd>
<p>

This command is used to subtract a background continuum from a
spectrum in the <b>r-array</b>. The program uses the following
algorithm to determine the background. First, the spectrum is binned
into a specified number of bins (<b>nbin</b>). In every bin the
minimum and maximum of the spectrum is calculated. If minumum and
maximum differ by less than <b>threshold</b> it is assumed that the
bin contains no spectral lines. If spectral lines are found in the bin
it is divided into smaller and smaller bins until a bin is found which
only contains the background spectrum or a minimal binsize of is
reached. Note that the number of bins is <b>not</b> increased in the
process.  If the background does not seem smooth, the background
calculation must be repeated with a larger number of bins.  The median
or the average of the spectrum in the bin is used to represent the
value of the background in the bin. After background bins have been
found inside each initial bin a spline is fitted to the background
data and (if desired) the background is subtracted from the data in
the <b>r-array</b>. Once the background has been calculated the option
<b>onlysubtract</b> can be used to subtract the background from the
spectrum without re-calculation of the background.
<b>onlysubtract</b> <b>MUST</b> be used <b>AFTER</b> a normal
background command.

<p>
A typical sequence to determine and subtract the background in a spectrum 
may look as follows:
<pre>
     open datain my_grotty               (open and read spectrum)
     alloc r 2M                          (make room in r array)
     read
     plot
     background  400  1.e-4              (determine background)
     background onlysubtract             (subtract background)
     dump my_beauty                      (create new data file)
</pre>
<p><br>

The <b>background</b> command is most useful for infrared spectra
which can have significant thermal backgrounds. The background must be
removed before finding and fitting lines. It can also be used to remove
the background from digitized photographic plate spectra to prepare
them for line finding.  Xgremlin's line finding commands work well
with plate spectra after background subtraction.  <p><br>

<b>Note:</b> Plotting of the background is turned off with a <b>plot data</b> command.

<h3>Examples:</h3>
<dl>
<dt> <b>background 400 1.0e-4</b>
<dd> calculates the background in 400 bins with a threshold of
     1.e-4 and plots it on top of the spectrum.<br><br>

<dt> <b>background 400 1.0e-4 subtract</b>
<dd> calculates the background and then subtracts it from the spectrum
     in the <b>r</b> array.<br><br>
</dl>
