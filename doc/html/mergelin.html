<h2>mergelin - merge two or more Gremlin line list (.lin) files</h2><p>

<b>Syntax:</b> <kbd>mergelin</kbd> <i>  -o &lt output file&gt &lt input files &gt
[ -t xxx.x ]</i><p>

<b>mergelin</b> is used to merge several Gremlin line list data files
(with .lin extension) into a single line list file. The program is
especially useful to combine the output from several <a
href="commands/linelist.html">linelist</a> commands in Xgremlin.
The resulting new line list file can be loaded into Xgremlin with the
<a href="commands/open.html">open lineio</a> command after a corresponding
spectrum has been read into the <b>r</b> array.
<p><br>

<h3>Options:</h3>
<dl>
<dt> <b>-o</b>
<dd> actually not an option because it <b>must</b> be given on the command line. 
It is followed by the name of the output file (without .lin extension).<p>

<dt> <b>-t</b> <kbd>xxx.x</kbd>
<dd> mergelin reads the line list data from every input file and
assembles the merged line list in memory before writing it out to
disk. If one of the input files contains a line that is <b>xxx.x</b>
wavenumbers closer to one of the lines already in the merged list it
will not be transferred to the output line list because it is assumed
that it is identical to the line already in the list.  <b>The default
threshold is 5mK (0.005/cm).</b> The -t option may be used to change
the threshold. If the threshold is set to 0 all lines will be included
in the output line list.
</dl>
<p><br>

<h3>Examples:</h3>
<dl>
<dt> <kbd>mergelin -o all.lin *.lin </kbd>
<dd> will merge all line list files in the current directory into a file
<b>all.lin</b>. Identical lines (within the default threshold) will 
appear only once in the output line list.<p>

<dt> <kbd>mergelin -o all.lin a.lin b.lin -t 0.0</kbd>
<dd> will merge all line list data from files <b>a.lin</b>
and <b>b.lin</b> into a single output file <b>all.lin</b>.
All lines will be included in the output file.
</dl>
