<h2>Installing Pre-compiled Binaries of Xgremlin</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This document explains how to install precompiled binary distributions
of Xgremlin. It will be updated if and when we distribute precompiled binaries.




<h3>Step 0: Tools and Libraries</h3>
In order for the binaries to work you must have the X11 libraries,
the 3d Athena Widget library installed and if you don't have a PostScript
printer you also have to install the PostScript interpreter 'GhostScript'.
Read the file <a href="Howto-Install.html"> Howto-Install, Step 0 </a> 
if you have not installed the libraries.
Note that some commercial Unixes (Suns come to mind) do not have the
complete set of libraries from the X Consortium installed.<p>

<h3>Step 1: Installing the binary distribution</h3>
Load down the appropriate file from the FTP server. Unpack the compressed 
archive with the following commands:
<pre>
    gzip -d xgremlin-<number>-<machine>.tar.gz
    tar xvf xgremlin-<number>-<machine>.tar
</pre>
or in one swoop:
<pre>
    gzip -dc xgremlin-<number>-<machine>.tar.gz | tar xvpf -
</pre>
(don't forget the trailing '-' !)<p>

Example:
<pre>
    gzip -dc xgremlin-2.7-linux-i386.tar.gz | tar xvpf -
</pre>
This command will unpack all files and store them in a directory
named './xgremlin-binaries'<p>

Change to this directory, become superuser, and type
<pre>
    make
</pre>
This will install the binaries in directory  /usr/local/bin  and set up
the required symbolic links.<p>

Finally change to the directory  /usr/local/bin  and remove any old
versions of Xgremlin unless you wish to save them.<p>

<h3>Note 1:</h3>
If this is the first installation also read the file <a
href="Howto-Install.html"> Howto-Install</a>, especially the sections
on configuring Xgremlin ( Step 3 ). At the very least you will have to
install documentation and drivers with the command 
<pre>
    make install-doc install-drivers
</pre>
issued in the xgremlin top level directory.

<h3>Note 2:</h3>
It is important the the application defaults file 'Xgremlin' was installed
in its correct place
<pre>
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults
</pre>
You should make sure that the application defaults database 'Xgremlin'
was correctly copied to this directory. 'Xgremlin' is the single most
important configuration file.
